# Examine the IPCC's Formal Steps to Develop Authoritative Assessment Reports

*CALS303_M1_02 -- Watch Script*

Have you ever tried to order a pizza for a bunch of scientists?

It's a nightmare. Nobody can agree on anything.

In fact, we love to debate each other so much that we go out of our way
once or twice a year---ironically burning fossil fuels to reach our
conference destinations---just to squabble and bicker about the minutiae
of climate science. That's what we do. That's who we are.

And we do it because we trust the process of science.

Science is 95 percent disproving things so that the last 5 percent is
extraordinarily robust.

But that's still not enough for the IPCC.

The authors of those reports apply the entire peer-review process one
more time---this time to already published papers. What you end up with
might be an enormous gluten-free, vegan, cheese pizza... but you can be
sure that no "bad stuff" made it into the final product.

And that study I worked on---the megadrought research I told you about
in the last lecture---the results barely made it into one clause of one
sentence in one chapter.

And I was honored by that.

Because that's how selective it is. That's how careful it is.

But here's what I want to emphasize today:

The IPCC process is not just a machine.

It is people.

Thousands of people.

When we talk about "Working Group I" or "Chapter 12" or "the Summary for
Policymakers," we are really talking about human beings.

Scientists who were nominated by governments and professional societies.

Scientists who were selected because of their expertise in paleoclimate,
modeling, atmospheric chemistry, hydrology, statistics, economics,
ecology, public health.

People who have spent decades collecting tree cores in freezing forests,
launching weather balloons, maintaining ocean buoys, debugging model
code at three in the morning, and arguing---sometimes fiercely---about
interpretation.

The process begins with scoping.

People gather and decide what questions the next assessment must answer.

Then governments and institutions nominate authors.

Then a bureau selects teams---trying to balance geography, discipline,
career stage, and perspective.

Then those people sit down---often virtually, sometimes in person---and
begin synthesizing thousands upon thousands of peer-reviewed studies.

They read.

They argue.

They debate wording.

They argue some more.

Drafts circulate.

Hundreds of experts submit comments.

Every substantive comment must be addressed.

Imagine that.

Tens of thousands of comments across a full assessment.

And behind every comment is a person.

A scientist who thinks a conclusion is overstated.

A scientist who thinks uncertainty is understated.

A scientist who believes a regional nuance has been overlooked.

Then governments review the drafts.

Not to rewrite the science.

But to ensure clarity, precision, and traceability.

And finally, the Summary for Policymakers is reviewed line by line.

Line.

By.

Line.

Scientists and government delegates sitting together ensuring that every
sentence reflects the underlying evidence.

It is slow.

It is exhausting.

It is profoundly human.

These are my colleagues, friends, mentors, former students,
collaborators, and in some cases, frenemies.

But they all have a particular set of skills in data collection, data
analysis, modeling, statistics, lab work, instrumentation, and much,
much more.

Climate science is arguably the most interdisciplinary field in the
world because you have to combine Earth's biogeochemical cycles with
weather, physics, atmospheric chemistry, oceanography, ecology, biology,
economics, and much, much more.

No single person holds all of that knowledge.

And that brings me to a quote I'm reminded of:

"I have found that no one is good enough to be trusted with unlimited
power. And I have found that the only way to ensure this is to spread
the power."\
--- G.K. Chesterton

I think that quote is deeply relevant to the way science---and
especially the IPCC process---works.

I know myself well enough to know that I do not know very much at all
about climate science, even though I've been doing it for twenty years.

It's too big.

Too interdisciplinary.

Too complex.

It cannot be held by any one individual.

Which is precisely why the report is so valuable.

Scientists argue.

They debate.

They disagree.

They get into bitter, career-long feuds about the interpretation of
ancient pollen records that reverberate across generations of
scientists.

And yet---through the IPCC process---they find consensus.

And that's what you read in those reports.

By their very nature, those reports are bland compared to some of the
spicier studies underpinning them.

They are conservative in the sense that they tell you:

It will be at least this bad---if not substantially worse.

That conservatism is not weakness.

It is distributed power.

It is institutional humility.

It is what happens when thousands of imperfect, passionate,
argumentative human beings submit their work to a shared process and
agree on what survives scrutiny.
