# Working Group III: Assessing Mitigation Pathways

In the previous lesson, we examined how physical changes in the climate system translate into risks for ecosystems, infrastructure, and human wellbeing.

Working Group II focuses on those impacts — how hazard, exposure, and vulnerability interact.

But once impacts are understood, another question follows.

Not whether warming is occurring.

Not only how it affects crops, cities, or coastlines.

But what it would take to alter its trajectory.

That is where Working Group III begins.

---

The authors of Working Group III are not primarily paleoclimatologists or atmospheric physicists.

Their expertise spans economics, energy systems engineering, integrated assessment modeling, public policy, finance, land-use systems, and technology transitions.

---

In the previous lesson, I mentioned my colleague Ariel Ortiz-Bobea, an agricultural economist.

We’ve worked on papers that are relevant to Working Group II — research showing how climate change is already affecting crop productivity.

But Ariel once pointed out something important to me.

---

As an economist, he noted that many of the scholars contributing to Working Group III are asking a different question entirely.

They are not only measuring impacts.

They are evaluating the costs of interventions — investments in renewable energy, infrastructure, and technological transition — and weighing those costs against long-term benefits to people who are not even alive today.

---

That is a fundamentally economic question.

How much should we invest now?

What do we avoid later?

And how do we value benefits that accrue decades into the future?

That is the domain of Working Group III.

---

Mitigation analysis operates within a simple physical constraint.

Global temperature change scales approximately with cumulative CO₂ emissions.

Stabilizing temperature therefore requires reducing net CO₂ emissions to zero.

---

That physical relationship sets the boundary conditions.

Working Group III evaluates how different sectors — energy, transportation, industry, agriculture, and land use — might reduce emissions under those constraints.

---

Infrastructure has long lifespans.

Power plants operate for decades.

Industrial facilities endure for half a century.

Urban development patterns shape emissions for generations.

---

Delayed mitigation increases cumulative emissions and requires steeper reductions later to remain within temperature limits.

Early action spreads transition costs over time.

Delayed action compresses them.

---

That is not ideology.

It is arithmetic.

---

Mitigation has visible costs.

Capital investment.

Grid expansion.

Electrification.

Research and deployment.

---

But inaction carries costs as well.

Disaster recovery.

Agricultural losses.

Health burdens.

Infrastructure damage.

---

Working Group III assesses both sides.

It does not prescribe policy.

It evaluates feasibility and tradeoffs.

---

Many low-emission technologies — particularly solar and wind — have experienced significant cost declines over the past decade.

Economic evaluation therefore includes not only direct costs, but avoided damages and co-benefits such as improved air quality and health outcomes.

---

At its core, mitigation analysis asks:

What pathways reduce long-term risk most effectively?

How do we balance present costs against future damages?

And how do we account for benefits that extend beyond the present generation?

---

Working Group I defines the physics.

Working Group II defines the consequences.

Working Group III defines the choices.

---

It maps the routes available within the carbon budget.

Some pathways require earlier investment.

Others accept higher future risk.

All remain constrained by atmospheric chemistry.

---

Understanding those routes does not compel action.

But it clarifies the consequences of delay.

---

In the next lesson, we will begin examining those pathways in greater detail — sector by sector — to understand where mitigation efforts matter most.
