# Filtering Colorado River Data to Communicate Risks Responsibly

## Introduction

Water decisions in the Colorado River Basin are being made in a climate
system that is both changing and contested. Scientific assessments
describe a Southwest trending toward greater aridity and intensified
drought, with warming already reducing water availability and increasing
evaporative demand. At the same time, projections of future river flow
depend on precipitation variability, internal climate variability, and
management choices that shape how risk unfolds. The challenge is not
merely identifying risk --- it is describing that risk with precision,
credibility, and clarity.

This exercise asks you to move from evaluating individual studies to
practicing the craft of synthesis. In high-stakes water negotiations,
short assessment statements often carry disproportionate influence. A
single paragraph can shape expectations, inform infrastructure
investments, or alter legal interpretations of shortage triggers.
Writing such a paragraph requires disciplined filtering: separating what
is well established from what is emerging, distinguishing climate-driven
pressures from policy-driven outcomes, and communicating uncertainty
without diluting urgency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scenario

You are drafting a short synthesis statement for a regional assessment
that will inform long-term reservoir operations and allocation
discussions.

Your audience includes:

-   Basin state negotiators\
-   Tribal water authorities\
-   Federal reservoir managers\
-   Municipal and agricultural planners

Your statement must:

-   Anchor itself in high-confidence scientific findings\
-   Use calibrated assessment language\
-   Clarify sources of uncertainty\
-   Remain actionable without overstating certainty

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 1: Classify the Evidence

Using the evidence categories provided (federal assessment findings,
CMIP6 analyses, basin syntheses, internal variability research, policy
uncertainty framing):

For each, determine:

-   **Confidence Level** (High / Medium / Low)\
-   **Primary Source of Uncertainty**
    -   Model spread\
    -   Precipitation variability\
    -   Internal climate variability\
    -   Policy or governance decisions\
    -   Limited empirical support\
-   **Assessment Placement**
    -   Core statement\
    -   Supporting detail\
    -   Methods note\
    -   Risk framing box

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 2: Write the Consensus Core (2--3 Sentences)

Your statement must:

1.  Begin with observational or assessment-grade framing.\
2.  Introduce forward-looking pressures using calibrated language (e.g.,
    "likely," "consistent with").\
3.  Explicitly identify at least one structured source of uncertainty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 3: Stakeholder Translation

Rewrite your statement for one audience:

-   Basin water manager\
-   Tribal water authority\
-   City mayor\
-   Agricultural district board

Preserve scientific integrity while clarifying what action or planning
approach logically follows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reflection

1.  Which uncertainty did you find most difficult to communicate
    clearly?\
2.  Did separating climate-driven and policy-driven uncertainty change
    how you described risk?\
3.  How might overemphasizing uncertainty reduce trust? How might
    underemphasizing it do the same?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Matters

Assessment writing is a discipline of restraint. It requires confidence
where evidence warrants it and caution where uncertainty remains
structured and meaningful. When uncertainty is explained rather than
obscured, it strengthens credibility. When risk is contextualized rather
than dramatized, it becomes actionable.

The ability to filter, synthesize, and communicate responsibly is
foundational to sustaining trust in climate science --- especially in
regions where water decisions carry economic, ecological, and legal
consequences.
