# Examine the Economics of Climate Action to Balance Costs and Opportunities

*CALS303_M3_04 -- Watch Script*

## Introduction: Why Economics Matters

Up to this point, we've examined physical constraints and structural
transitions.

Now we confront the economic question directly:

Is climate action economically justified?

Mitigation requires investment. That much is clear. But economic
assessment does not stop at upfront cost. It weighs those costs against
avoided damages, reduced adaptation burdens, and long-term structural
opportunity.

Working Group III of the IPCC evaluates this balance explicitly.

The question is not whether mitigation costs money.

It is whether delay costs more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Avoided Damages and Reduced Risk

Climate change already imposes measurable economic losses. Extreme
weather, sea-level rise, heat stress, and agricultural disruption all
carry financial consequences.

The IPCC reports that when economic models incorporate climate damages,
many find that limiting warming to around 2°C produces benefits that
exceed mitigation costs --- though results depend on assumptions about
discounting and damage estimates (IPCC AR6 WGIII SPM, 2022).

That caveat matters. Damage estimates vary. Discount rates vary.

But the direction of change is consistent: higher warming increases
economic loss.

Mitigation reduces future exposure.

In economic terms, mitigation reduces long-term liability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Investment Requirements

Mitigation is capital-intensive.

The IPCC finds that pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C
or 2°C require global investment in mitigation to increase several-fold
this decade relative to current levels (IPCC AR6 WGIII SPM).

The UNEP Emissions Gap Report similarly concludes that closing the gap
between current trajectories and 1.5°C-aligned pathways requires
large-scale redirection of financial flows toward low-emission sectors.

The important distinction is this:

Global capital is not scarce.\
Investment direction is misaligned.

Financial systems continue to support fossil infrastructure at levels
inconsistent with mitigation pathways. Redirecting capital, rather than
discovering new capital, is the core challenge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Timing and Cost Escalation

Timing shapes cost.

Early mitigation spreads investment over time and allows infrastructure
to turn over gradually.

Delayed mitigation compresses transition into shorter windows. That
often requires accelerated deployment, early retirement of assets, and
greater reliance on unproven technologies.

IPCC assessments consistently show that delayed pathways raise
cumulative costs and increase dependence on large-scale carbon removal
later in the century.

Delay is not costless.

It shifts cost forward and magnifies uncertainty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Economic Opportunity and Co-Benefits

Mitigation is not solely defensive.

Costs of key technologies --- including solar photovoltaics, wind power,
and batteries --- have declined dramatically over the past decade (IPCC
AR6 WGIII SPM).

These declines alter the economic landscape. Low-emission technologies
are no longer niche in many regions; they compete directly with fossil
alternatives.

There are also co-benefits.

Reduced air pollution lowers health costs.\
Lower fossil fuel dependence improves energy security.\
Innovation stimulates new industries.

These effects are part of the economic calculus, even if they are
sometimes excluded from simplified cost comparisons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## GDP Effects in Context

One persistent concern is whether mitigation undermines economic growth.

IPCC modelling indicates that mitigation modestly adjusts projected GDP
growth relative to baseline scenarios. In many modeled pathways, global
GDP still increases substantially through mid-century, even under
ambitious mitigation (IPCC AR6 WGIII SPM).

These estimates typically exclude avoided damages.

When avoided climate damages are included, net economic outcomes improve
further.

Mitigation alters growth trajectories slightly.

Unmitigated climate change alters them more severely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion: Reframing the Economic Question

The economic debate is often framed narrowly: How much does mitigation
cost?

A more complete framing asks:

What does mitigation cost relative to escalating climate damages?\
How does timing influence total expenditure?\
What structural opportunities emerge from transition?

Mitigation requires substantial investment.

But in cumulative systems, delay accumulates liability.

The relevant comparison is not cost versus zero.

It is cost now versus greater cost later.

In the next lesson, we will examine more detailed comparisons of action
versus inaction across different time horizons and modelling
assumptions.

Because once economics enters the picture, sequencing and tradeoffs
become unavoidable.
