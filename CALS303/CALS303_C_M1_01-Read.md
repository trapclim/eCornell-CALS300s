# Navigate the Climate Science Funnel of Working Group 1 to Produce Actionable Conclusions

Scientific knowledge does not arrive in polished summaries. It
accumulates---paper by paper, dataset by dataset---until the landscape
becomes too vast for any one person to survey. The previous watch
introduced the formal structure of Working Group I. Here we step inside
the process itself: how thousands of independent studies become a small
number of carefully worded conclusions.

Think of each published climate study as a proposal entering a crowded
arena of ideas. Many are rigorous. Many are valuable. Yet only a
fraction ultimately shape the statements that guide international
climate negotiations. This narrowing is not accidental---it is
structural.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## From Research to Assessment

The IPCC does not conduct original research. Instead, it assesses
existing peer-reviewed literature. That distinction matters. Assessment
is an act of synthesis: weighing evidence across studies, comparing
methodologies, identifying convergence, and clarifying uncertainty.

Peer review establishes that a study meets disciplinary standards. IPCC
assessment asks a different question: how does this study fit within the
broader weight of evidence?

That shift---from validating individual findings to evaluating
collective agreement---is the beginning of the funnel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Funnel in Practice

Working Group I's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) illustrates the scale of
this refinement. The first-order draft alone received over **23,000
expert review comments**, each requiring author response and
documentation. Subsequent drafts underwent further expert and government
review before final approval of the Summary for Policymakers.

At each stage, three dynamics are at work:

1.  **Relevance** -- Does the study directly inform the chapter's
    scope?\
2.  **Corroboration** -- Are similar findings supported by independent
    lines of evidence?\
3.  **Clarity of Confidence** -- Can the conclusion be expressed with
    calibrated uncertainty language?

The funnel narrows not by discarding dissenting science, but by
privileging what is reproducible, convergent, and globally informative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Strong Research May Remain Outside the Report

Many credible studies never appear prominently in assessment text. This
is not a measure of quality. Often they are:

-   Highly regional in focus\
-   Exploratory or early in an emerging field\
-   Superseded by newer analyses\
-   One data point within a larger evidentiary mosaic

Assessment requires integration. It asks not only "Is this correct?" but
"How representative is this finding across contexts and methods?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Selectivity and Scientific Conservatism

Because conclusions must withstand multiple rounds of international
review, the language of IPCC reports often appears cautious. This
caution is deliberate. It reflects a requirement for broad agreement
across disciplines, datasets, and modeling approaches.

In this sense, the final document is not the sharpest edge of research.
It is the most stable foundation beneath it.

Understanding this helps clarify why assessment reports are frequently
described as conservative syntheses rather than speculative forecasts.
They represent what the scientific community can say collectively---with
documented confidence---at a specific moment in time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A Knowledge Architecture Larger Than One Working Group

Working Group I provides the physical science basis. But the same
narrowing process unfolds across the other working groups as they assess
impacts, vulnerability, and mitigation. Each begins with an immense
literature and ends with calibrated conclusions designed for policy
relevance.

The funnel, then, is not merely procedural. It is epistemological. It is
how distributed scientific effort becomes shared global understanding.

And once you see that structure, you begin to understand how climate
knowledge---carefully filtered and collectively refined---moves from
journals into the decisions that shape our future.
