# Evaluate Mitigation Pathways Using Stabilization Wedges (Reframed Through Current Assessments)

*CALS303_M3_05 -- Watch Script*

## Introduction

Earlier in this module, we examined carbon budgets and Earth's energy
imbalance --- the difference between incoming solar radiation and
outgoing infrared energy. That imbalance drives warming.

The physical requirement is straightforward:

To stabilize temperature, net CO₂ emissions must fall to zero.

The question is not whether emissions must decline.

It is how quickly, at what scale, and through which combinations of
actions.

To explore that question, we revisit the stabilization wedge framework
--- not as a historical artifact, but as a tool for thinking about scale
in the era of net-zero.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## From Holding Emissions Flat to Driving Them Down

In 2004, Pacala and Socolow introduced stabilization wedges to show that
avoiding further emissions growth could be achieved by deploying several
large-scale mitigation strategies simultaneously.

At the time, the objective was to hold global emissions roughly constant
for several decades.

Today, the target is far more demanding.

According to the UNEP Emissions Gap Report, limiting warming to 1.5°C
requires global greenhouse gas emissions to decline sharply this decade
and reach net-zero CO₂ around mid-century.

That is not stabilization in the early-2000s sense.

It is sustained decline toward zero.

Under current IPCC assessments, temperature stabilization occurs only
when net emissions reach zero and the atmospheric stock of CO₂ stops
increasing.

The wedge concept still helps --- but the slope of the triangle is
steeper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What a Wedge Represents

A stabilization wedge represents a mitigation strategy that grows over
time, reaching a substantial emissions reduction by mid-century.

Examples include large-scale renewable deployment, electrification of
transport, efficiency improvements, nuclear expansion, reforestation, or
carbon capture.

Each wedge assumes sustained, global-scale deployment of a specific
technology or practice.

But here is the critical update:

Global CO₂ emissions are on the order of tens of gigatons per year.

Avoiding one gigaton is meaningful.

Avoiding tens of gigatons requires multiple wedges, deployed rapidly and
in parallel.

The question is no longer whether a strategy works in principle.

It is whether it scales to planetary magnitude.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scale and Physical Constraints

A useful illustration of scale came up in a conversation with my
colleague Dan Visioni. We asked a simple question: what if we tried to
offset current emissions using a fast-growing crop like hemp?

The answer was sobering. To absorb emissions at current global levels
would require land area on the order of an entire continent, cultivated
intensively and continuously.

That is the scale of the problem.

Biological carbon removal can contribute. Reforestation and soil
management matter. But land area is finite. Expanding bioenergy crops
competes with food systems and ecosystems. Large-scale afforestation
reshapes water cycles and biodiversity.

Natural systems help, but they cannot absorb tens of gigatons per year
without major land transformation.

Similarly, electrification requires minerals, grid expansion, and
storage infrastructure.

Carbon capture requires energy inputs and geological storage capacity.

Every wedge interacts with material, land, energy, and governance
constraints.

This is what modern mitigation assessment emphasizes: not just technical
feasibility, but scale feasibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Portfolio Thinking Under Carbon Budgets

The wedge framework encourages portfolio thinking.

No single technology closes the emissions gap.

But portfolios today must satisfy stricter conditions than in 2004:

They must produce rapid near-term reductions.\
They must align with remaining carbon budgets.\
They must reach net-zero.\
They must minimize overshoot and reliance on future carbon removal.

IPCC assessments repeatedly show that delayed reductions increase
dependence on large-scale negative emissions later in the century.

That increases uncertainty.

Wedges remain useful because they force quantitative thinking:

How much does this strategy reduce?\
How quickly can it scale?\
What resources does it require?\
What trade-offs does it create?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

Stabilization wedges were originally introduced to show that climate
mitigation was not impossible.

Today, they serve a different purpose.

They remind us that scale matters.

Temperature stabilization is not symbolic. It requires measurable,
sustained global reductions to net-zero.

Each wedge represents a commitment to deploy technologies and practices
at planetary scale.

The question is not whether solutions exist.

It is whether they can be deployed fast enough, at sufficient magnitude,
within physical and political constraints, to close the emissions gap.

In the next activity, you will evaluate mitigation portfolios through
this lens --- not for theoretical elegance, but for their capacity to
materially alter emissions trajectories.

Because stabilization is not a metaphor.

It is a physical condition.
