# Bridge Science and Policy to Encourage Cooperative Climate Action

*CALS303_M4_01 -- Watch Script*

## Introduction

By this point in the course, you understand the science.

You understand radiative forcing, carbon budgets, and why net-zero CO₂
is required to stabilize temperature. You've examined impacts and the
economics of delay.

But climate change does not move from model output to policy
automatically.

In 2016, the Paris Agreement entered into force. Nearly every nation on
Earth agreed to limit warming to well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to
limit it to 1.5°C. Rather than imposing top-down mandates, the agreement
relies on Nationally Determined Contributions --- or NDCs.

An NDC is each country's own plan for reducing emissions. Countries set
their targets, report progress, and update their ambition over time.

In the United States, a related tool is the National Climate Assessment,
or NCA. The NCA is a congressionally mandated scientific report that
evaluates how climate change affects regions, sectors, and communities
across the country. It translates physical science into policy-relevant
risk.

Together, these efforts illustrate something important:

Science defines what is happening.\
Policy determines what we do about it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Science Sets the Constraints

The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report states clearly that human influence
has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land.

It also makes clear that limiting warming requires rapid, deep, and
sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Remaining carbon
budgets are finite. Delay narrows options.

Energy system analyses reinforce this conclusion. Pathways to net-zero
exist. Renewable deployment, electrification, efficiency improvements,
and industrial innovation can reduce emissions at scale.

Physics does not prevent the transition.

Engineering does not prevent it.

But neither physics nor engineering can compel cooperation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Unequal Starting Points

Climate politics begins with inequality.

Industrialized nations built prosperity using fossil fuels. That energy
powered infrastructure, healthcare systems, transportation networks, and
manufacturing.

Many developing nations still face energy poverty. Their immediate
priorities include reliable electricity, economic growth, and poverty
reduction.

The Paris Agreement reflects this tension through the principle of
"Common but Differentiated Responsibilities." All countries share the
obligation to address climate change, but historical emissions and
economic capacity matter.

For a rapidly developing country, replacing coal with renewables may be
technically feasible --- but financing, grid infrastructure, and
institutional stability determine whether it is realistic.

This is not disagreement about atmospheric physics.

It is disagreement about development pathways and fairness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Ambition Gap

The United Nations Environment Programme publishes an annual Emissions
Gap Report. It compares what countries have pledged through their NDCs
with what emissions levels are required to meet global temperature
goals.

The gap remains significant.

The Paris framework relies on transparency and iterative ambition.
Countries are expected to strengthen their commitments over time. There
are reporting requirements and global stocktakes, but no enforcement
authority.

Climate governance operates through cooperation rather than coercion.

That makes trust central.

When wealthier nations pledge climate finance --- such as the
long-standing goal of mobilizing \$100 billion annually for developing
countries --- follow-through affects credibility.

When promises lag, confidence erodes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Energy, Security, and Geopolitics

Major economies are navigating complex transitions.

Some expand renewables rapidly while still managing fossil fuel
dependence. Others balance industrial competitiveness with emissions
reductions.

Energy security concerns, supply chains, inflation, and geopolitical
tensions shape decision-making.

Renewable technologies have become more cost-competitive in many
markets. But scaling them requires capital, grid modernization, and
long-term planning.

Capital is unevenly distributed.

Cooperation therefore depends not only on technical feasibility, but on
perceived equity and shared benefit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion: From Consensus to Coordination

The scientific evidence is strong.

The technological pathways exist.

The economic case for mitigation is compelling.

What remains uncertain is coordination among nearly 200 sovereign
nations with different histories, capacities, and priorities.

Bridging science and policy means recognizing that climate change is not
only a physical system.

It is a collective-action problem.

Stability depends on cooperation.

In the next reading, we'll examine how negotiations unfold in practice
--- and how media narratives and political framing shape public
understanding of responsibility and fairness.

Because climate stability will depend not only on what we know.

It will depend on how effectively we work together.
