# Integrate Multiple Sectors into a Coherent Global Decarbonization Strategy

*CALS303_M3_03 -- Watch Script*

## Introduction

In the last lesson, you mapped sectors.

You examined how electricity, transportation, industry, agriculture, and
land use might decarbonize individually. Each sector has tools. Each has
constraints.

But sectors do not operate independently.

The real challenge is not solving one sector at a time. It is
integrating them into a coherent global strategy.

Decarbonization is not a collection of isolated fixes.

It is a structural transformation of interconnected systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interdependence: Why Sectoral Silos Fail

Consider electrification.

Replacing gasoline vehicles with electric vehicles reduces tailpipe
emissions. But electric vehicles draw power from the grid. If the grid
remains fossil-based, emissions shift upstream rather than decline
substantially.

Transportation decarbonization therefore depends on electricity
decarbonization.

Now extend that logic to industry.

Producing steel, cement, and chemicals requires large amounts of
high-temperature heat. Many decarbonization pathways rely on
electrification or hydrogen. Hydrogen production, in turn, requires
substantial electricity input.

So electrifying transport increases electricity demand.\
Electrifying industry increases it further.

If generation, storage, and transmission infrastructure do not expand in
parallel, bottlenecks emerge.

Sectoral transitions must be synchronized.

Without coordination, one success creates strain elsewhere.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Land Use and Energy Competition

Now shift to land.

Forests and soils absorb carbon. Reforestation and improved land
management can increase sequestration. But land is finite.

Bioenergy crops, if expanded at scale, compete with food production and
ecosystems. Clearing forests to grow energy crops can eliminate the very
carbon sinks mitigation depends upon.

Energy decisions affect land use.\
Agricultural policy affects sequestration potential.\
Conservation policy affects mitigation capacity.

Again, sectors interlock.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Industrial Pathways and Infrastructure Dependencies

Heavy industry adds another layer.

Low-carbon steel may require hydrogen.\
Hydrogen requires electricity.\
Carbon capture requires transport networks and geological storage sites.

Each technological pathway depends on parallel infrastructure
investment.

If electricity expansion lags, hydrogen cannot scale.\
If storage networks lag, carbon capture remains limited.

Integration is not optional.

It is the difference between demonstration and deployment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Policy Coordination and System Coherence

Because sectors are interconnected, policy must be coordinated.

Incentivizing electric vehicles without grid investment strains the
system.\
Promoting biofuels without land safeguards risks deforestation.\
Pricing industrial emissions without innovation support may shift
production geographically rather than reduce global emissions.

Decarbonization strategy must align:

Energy generation\
Transmission expansion\
Industrial retrofits\
Transportation standards\
Land stewardship

The objective is not isolated optimization.

It is systemic coherence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

The central lesson is straightforward.

Electrifying transportation reshapes electricity demand.\
Grid expansion reshapes land use.\
Land management reshapes sequestration capacity.\
Industrial transformation depends on energy infrastructure.

Every intervention reverberates.

A coherent global strategy anticipates those reverberations.

But integration increases complexity. It raises questions about
sequencing, cost allocation, investment timing, and equity.

In the next lesson, we turn to those economic dimensions.

Because once you see the system, the next question becomes unavoidable:

How do you coordinate investment across it?
