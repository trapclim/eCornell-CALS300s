# Activity: Navigating Narratives and Values to Persuade Global Action

## Why this activity matters

When climate responsibility is discussed in public, the same meeting can
sound like three different stories: an urgent moral reckoning, a
cautious step forward, or an unfair bill being handed to someone who
didn't order the meal. Those frames don't merely color opinion; they
shape what people think is reasonable, what they think is "fair," and
what kind of cooperation feels legitimate.

This activity focuses on the practical problem underneath the headlines:
if global action depends on agreement among groups with different
priorities, then persuasion often requires more than repeating facts. It
requires learning how different value systems translate climate
responsibility into policy preferences---and how to communicate in ways
that can be heard across those differences.

## Scenario: Three voices at one table

Imagine three family members at Thanksgiving debating whether wealthy
nations should financially support developing countries in transitioning
to clean energy. Each person reflects a recognizable narrative and a
distinct moral emphasis.

### Character A --- The Justice Advocate

-   Emphasizes historical responsibility and climate justice\
-   Frames support as a moral obligation\
-   Often appeals to **Care** and **Fairness** (accountability)

### Character B --- The Institutional Pragmatist

-   Focuses on feasibility, incremental progress, and negotiated
    mechanisms\
-   Frames support as a structured policy challenge\
-   Often appeals to **Authority** and procedural **Fairness** (rules
    and trust)

### Character C --- The Sovereignty Defender

-   Questions feasibility and fairness of wealth transfers\
-   Frames support as a risk to domestic stability and autonomy\
-   Often appeals to **Liberty** and **Loyalty** (national obligation)

## Part 1: Apply SACCHL to each character's claims

Individually evaluate each character's statements using the
**Scientifically Accurate Claims Checklist (SACCHL)**.

For each character, identify:

1.  Which statements rest on scientific consensus (and which do not)?
2.  Where are they making assumptions rather than empirical claims?
3.  What is being emphasized---and what is being left out?
4.  How does their framing steer the listener toward a policy
    conclusion?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 2: Map the value axes

Using the moral/value axes discussed in the module---**Care**,
**Liberty**, **Loyalty/Groupishness**, **Authority**, **Sanctity**, with
**Fairness** often at the center---answer:

-   Which values does each character prioritize most?
-   Do they mean the same thing by "fairness," or different things?
-   Where might there be overlap that could support cooperation?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 3: Write a brief disagreement that includes reframing

Choose **two** characters and write a short script (about 1--2
paragraphs) in which they disagree about whether and how wealthy nations
should support developing countries' clean energy transitions.

**Requirements:** - Preserve the integrity of both positions (no
caricatures) - Show the values beneath the argument - Attempt at least
one reframing that "translates" a claim into the other person's value
language

Possible reframing moves: - Moral obligation → economic resilience /
market stability\
- Justice → risk management / security and migration pressures\
- Shared responsibility → predictable rules that protect domestic
interests

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reflection

After writing, respond briefly:

1.  Which values were hardest to align or reconcile?
2.  Did reframing help you find any common ground---or at least mutual
    respect?
3.  Which translation strategy felt most plausible in a real policy
    setting?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Closing Thought

Global cooperation often depends on people finding a bridge between what
they care about and what they can agree to do. The goal here isn't to
erase disagreement; it's to learn how disagreement can still produce
workable commitments---especially when the costs, responsibilities, and
risks are distributed unevenly.
