## Project: Translating Foundational Research into Consensus-Based Climate Guidance

It’s one thing to admire how careful and credible major climate assessments are. It’s another thing to *use* them—honestly—when a real person has to make a real decision with incomplete information, competing priorities, and uncertainty that won’t politely resolve itself.

This project asks you to do exactly that. You’ll take a hazard that matters to a specific stakeholder, then read across three scales of assessment—not to decide which one is “right,” but to understand what each is designed to do, what each cannot do, and what choices are quietly embedded in the final wording.

To anchor your work, you’ll compare **three** assessment scales for the same hazard/variable:

- **IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report (2023)** (global consensus)
- **USGCRP Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5, 2023)** (national translation)
- **NYSERDA / New York State Climate Impacts Assessment** (state-level translation)

Your goal is to identify what gets **added**, what gets **softened**, what gets **omitted**, and—most importantly—**why**.

## Canvas “New Quiz” Setup
**Quiz title:** Translating Foundational Research into Consensus-Based Climate Guidance  
**Question types:** Multiple Choice, Multiple Select, Short Answer, File Upload / Text Entry (Submission)

---

## Part A — Concepts & Reading Accuracy (auto-graded)

### Q1 (Multiple Choice)
**Why can IPCC conclusions read as more cautious than national or state assessments?**  
A. The IPCC avoids peer-reviewed research.  
B. The IPCC is designed to synthesize globally using consensus-based, calibrated uncertainty language.  
C. National/state assessments are always more accurate.  
D. The IPCC reports only on weather, not climate.

**Correct answer:** B  
**Feedback (Correct):** Yes. The IPCC’s global scope and consensus process pushes toward careful claims that can be supported across diverse regions and evidence bases.  
**Feedback (Incorrect):** The key issue is scope + purpose. The IPCC is not “less scientific”—it is designed to be globally consistent and consensus-based.

---

### Q2 (Multiple Select)
**Which are valid reasons a state assessment might feel more “actionable” than a global synthesis? (Select all that apply.)**  
A. It can translate hazards into sector-specific planning needs and thresholds.  
B. It can include local exposure, vulnerability, and adaptation constraints.  
C. It can use regional tools (e.g., downscaling) to emphasize place-based signals.  
D. It is allowed to ignore uncertainty.

**Correct answers:** A, B, C  
**Feedback (Correct):** Exactly—actionability often comes from adding decision context, not removing scientific caution.  
**Feedback (Incorrect):** If you chose D: credible assessments communicate uncertainty differently, but they don’t discard it.

---

### Q3 (Short Answer)
**In 3–5 sentences: What does it mean for an assessment to be “consensus-based,” and what is one tradeoff that creates for local decision-making?**  
**Instructor feedback targets:** calibrated language, breadth of evidence, consistency vs. specificity, and/or “lag” in translating new evidence.

## Part B — Your Case (graded submission)

### Q4 (Short Answer)
**Select your region and stakeholder (4–6 sentences).**  
Identify:  
1) Region (NY region is allowed, but not required)  
2) Stakeholder (e.g., municipal planner, coastal emergency manager, agricultural cooperative, public health agency)  
3) The hazard/variable that matters most (e.g., extreme heat, flooding, drought, sea-level rise, wildfire smoke)  
4) One concrete decision they must make (e.g., zoning, infrastructure investment, heat plan, crop strategy)

**Feedback (strong submission):** Clear decision context + why the climate variable matters operationally.  
**Feedback (needs work):** Vague stakeholder or no real decision described.

---

### Q5 (File Upload or Text Entry)
**Gather three comparable sources (submit citations + links + the sections you used).**  
You must provide:

1) **IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report (2023)** — cite the exact section(s) you used  
2) **NCA5 (2023, USGCRP)** — cite the exact chapter/region/sector pages you used  
3) **NYSERDA / NYS Climate Impacts Assessment** — cite the exact chapter/summary pages you used

**Feedback (strong submission):** Same hazard/variable across all three + specific sections identified.  
**Feedback (needs work):** Mismatched hazards or “whole report” citations without page/section specificity.

---

### Q6 (Essay / Long Answer)
**Triangulate guidance across scales (~800–1,100 words).**  
Write an analysis that answers all prompts:

1) **Global framing:** How is the hazard framed globally? What does the language suggest about confidence/uncertainty and risk?  
2) **National translation:** How is the same hazard framed for the U.S.? What sectors and impacts are emphasized?  
3) **State translation:** How is the hazard framed for New York? What local vulnerabilities, thresholds, or adaptation priorities appear?  
4) **Added / softened / missing:** Provide:  
   - **Two** examples of added specificity at national/state levels (metrics, thresholds, planning guidance, sector detail)  
   - **One** example of something present in one scale but muted/absent in another  
5) **Why these differences exist:** Discuss purpose, audience, consensus constraints, spatial resolution, and decision context.

**Feedback (strong submission):** Direct comparisons with specific examples (not parallel summaries), and an explanation of *why* differences arise.  
**Feedback (needs work):** Summaries without comparison, or claims without citing where they appear.

### Q7 (Multiple Choice)
**Which approach is the most responsible way to use these three assessments for stakeholder decisions?**  
A. Use state only; global consensus is too broad to matter.  
B. Use IPCC only; local reports are always biased.  
C. Use IPCC for global evidence/confidence, NCA5 for U.S. sector/region framing, and NYS for state-relevant thresholds and planning context.  
D. Average projections from all three to get the “true” number.

**Correct answer:** C  
**Feedback (Correct):** Yes—this is purpose-aware synthesis across scales.  
**Feedback (Incorrect):** A/B discard complementary strengths; D creates false precision and can erase uncertainty.

---

## Part C — Capstone Synthesis (graded submission)

### Q8 (Text Entry — “Public-Facing Briefing”)
**Write a concise briefing for your stakeholder (250–350 words).**  
Your briefing must:  
- State the hazard and what matters most for the stakeholder  
- Use **one** key takeaway from each assessment scale (IPCC, NCA5, NYS)  
- Make **one** actionable recommendation that is robust under uncertainty  
- Include a short note on what information is still uncertain and how to plan anyway  
- Name **one** decision-relevant question you *wish* the reports answered more directly (and a plausible reason it might not appear clearly in a consensus-style document)

**Feedback (strong submission):** Clear, decision-ready, appropriately cautious, grounded in all three sources, and honest about what’s hard to pin down.  
**Feedback (needs work):** Overconfident claims, no use of all three sources, or no actionable step.
