## Trace Carbon's Journey to Quantify Sources and Map Low-Carbon Futures

Emissions inventories tell us where carbon enters the system. But
numbers alone do not explain what happens next. To understand why
accounting frameworks matter, we must follow carbon beyond the
spreadsheet---into the atmosphere, across the oceans, through forests
and soils, and down into the rocks of Earth's crust.

An enormous amount of carbon is constantly in motion. Each year, vast
quantities cycle between atmosphere, ocean, and land. Even larger
quantities remain stored in sediments and the crust below. Stability
depends not simply on the size of these reservoirs, but on the
timescales over which carbon moves between them.

Some carbon cycles quickly---seasonally, annually, decadally. Plants
draw CO₂ from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Respiration returns
it. Oceans exchange gases with the air. Rivers transport dissolved
carbon to the sea. These flows are immense, far exceeding annual human
emissions. Under relatively stable conditions, however, they are largely
balanced. Carbon circulates rapidly, yet atmospheric concentration
remains comparatively steady.

Other carbon moves slowly---over hundreds of thousands to millions of
years. Chemical weathering removes CO₂ from the atmosphere. Carbonate
minerals form and settle to the ocean floor. Organic matter is buried
and transformed into fossil fuels. Tectonic processes eventually recycle
some of that carbon back to the atmosphere through volcanic degassing.
This long-term carbon cycle functions as a planetary regulator, but it
operates on geological time.

Fossil fuels bridge these two systems. They are ancient carbon, once
part of living systems, buried for hundreds of millions of years. When
extracted and combusted, that carbon is transferred almost instantly
from the slow geological reservoir into the fast atmospheric cycle. What
was once separated by deep time becomes compressed into decades.

This is why modern emissions cannot be understood as simply another
natural flux. We are accelerating geological carbon into the short-term
cycle at a rate that the fast system cannot fully absorb. Land and
oceans remove a substantial fraction of emitted CO₂, but not all of it.
The remainder accumulates in the atmosphere, increasing concentration
and strengthening the greenhouse effect.

The significance of that accumulation becomes clear through the carbon
budget framework articulated by the IPCC. Warming is closely
proportional to cumulative CO₂ emissions. In practical terms, total
temperature increase depends largely on the total amount of CO₂ humanity
emits over time. Every additional ton contributes to the cumulative
total; none is erased simply because it was emitted in a different year.

From this relationship emerges the idea of a remaining carbon budget: a
finite amount of additional CO₂ that can be emitted while limiting
warming to a chosen threshold, such as 1.5°C or 2°C above preindustrial
levels. These budgets are probabilistic, reflecting uncertainties in
climate sensitivity and Earth system responses. A higher probability of
meeting a temperature target corresponds to a smaller allowable budget.

The implication is stark but clarifying. Emissions reductions are not
merely symbolic gestures; they are adjustments to a finite ledger
governed by physical constraints. Delays consume the remaining
allowance. Rapid reductions preserve it.

The thermostat analogy illustrates the deeper tension. Over geological
timescales, Earth can draw down excess CO₂ through weathering and
burial. But those processes unfold over hundreds of thousands of years.
Human societies operate on generational timescales. By releasing fossil
carbon rapidly, we are adjusting the thermostat faster than the slow
regulatory system can counterbalance. The fast carbon cycle absorbs part
of the disturbance, but accumulation persists.

A low-carbon future therefore means reshaping carbon's movement through
the system. It requires reducing transfers from geological storage into
the atmosphere through clean energy, electrification, efficiency, and
industrial redesign. It also requires protecting forests, soils, and
ecosystems that moderate atmospheric concentrations. Carbon removal
approaches may supplement these efforts, but they do not eliminate the
need to limit fossil fuel emissions at their source.

Carbon has always moved through Earth's system. What distinguishes the
present is the speed and scale at which we are redirecting that
movement. Quantifying carbon's journey---from emission source to
atmospheric concentration to cumulative constraint---reveals that
mitigation pathways are not abstract ambitions. They are choices about
how quickly and how decisively we alter the flow of carbon through
interconnected reservoirs.

Understanding those flows is the foundation for evaluating which futures
are physically plausible, economically coherent, and climatically
stable.
