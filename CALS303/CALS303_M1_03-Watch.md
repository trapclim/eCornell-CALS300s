# Extend Understanding from Physical Science to Impacts, Risk, and Mitigation

Before I joined Cornell, most of my research on climate change was directly relevant to Working Group I of the IPCC.

Working Group I assesses the physical science basis of climate change.

---

It looks at how fast climate change is occurring.

Why it is happening.

Which regions are changing.

Which variables are involved.

And what physical processes are associated with those changes.

---

It translates the basic energy imbalance from rising CO₂ in the atmosphere into a fully global picture of change.

And it assesses the causes of those changes.

---

It doesn’t just examine carbon dioxide.

It also looks at the role of land-use change.

And aerosols.

---

Since joining Cornell, I’ve also had the privilege of working with colleagues like Ariel Ortiz-Bobea at the Dyson School.

On studies that are more directly relevant to Working Group II.

---

Working Group II assesses impacts.

For example, one of Ariel’s papers that I worked on showed how rising temperatures and broader global change are already affecting crop yields.

---

That research translates physical changes in the climate system into measurable agricultural and economic consequences.

And in a nutshell, that’s what Working Group II is charged with doing.

---

It asks:

How do physical changes translate into impacts on human and natural systems?

---

Working Group II covers an enormous range of sectors, regions, and ecosystems affected by climate change.

---

A central concept in the Working Group II assessment is risk.

---

Risk emerges from the interaction of three components:

Hazard.

Exposure.

And vulnerability.

---

Hazards are climate-related events.

Heat waves.

Droughts.

Heavy rainfall.

Sea-level rise.

Marine heat waves.

And more.

---

Exposure refers to people, infrastructure, crops, ecosystems, and economic systems that are in harm’s way.

---

Vulnerability refers to how susceptible those exposed systems are to harm.

It is shaped by sensitivity, adaptive capacity, economic resources, marginalization, and physical infrastructure.

---

Risk is not determined by hazard alone.

It emerges from the intersection of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.

---

For example, a heat wave is a hazard.

A city like Chicago may be exposed to that hazard.

---

Whether that heat wave becomes a climate disaster depends on vulnerability.

Does the population have access to air conditioning?

Adequate healthcare?

Reliable power?

Cooling centers?

---

Now consider two regions.

---

One is a middle-class suburb in Phoenix, Arizona, with widespread cooling infrastructure and reliable power.

A heat wave of 127 degrees in Phoenix is severe, but not unprecedented.

---

Now imagine that same heat wave occurring in a densely populated Midwestern or Northeastern city with far fewer households equipped with air conditioning.

Insufficient hospital capacity.

And inadequate infrastructure to help people escape heat stress.

---

The hazard is the same.

But the exposure and vulnerability differ.

And therefore the risk differs.

---

These differences become even more pronounced when comparing countries.

Low-income and high-income nations face very different vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities.

---

Working Group II documents that climate change is already affecting ecosystems and human systems across a vast number of sectors and regions worldwide.

---

And risks increase with warming — especially where exposure and vulnerability are high.

---

Another key point is that impacts are often driven by extremes, not averages.

---

A single hurricane can cause billions of dollars in damage.

A poorly timed drought in the middle of the growing season can devastate farmers.

Even a few weeks of extreme heat during crop tasseling can be an enormous setback.

---

A single marine heat wave can collapse an entire fishery.

---

Adaptation is therefore a major theme in Working Group II.

Especially because global mitigation has not yet reduced CO₂ emissions fast enough to eliminate near-term risks.

---

Working Group II assesses how adaptation can reduce risk by decreasing exposure and vulnerability within that three-part framework.

---

If we cannot immediately eliminate hazards, then exposure and vulnerability are the levers we can adjust.

---

Examples include redesigning infrastructure to withstand heat waves and floods.

Shifting to more drought-tolerant or heat-tolerant crops.

Expanding water storage systems.

Improving emergency response and healthcare capacity.

---

But adaptation has limits.

As hazards grow in intensity, frequency, and magnitude, they may exceed the capacity of systems to adapt.

Leading to losses, damages, and in some cases, collapse.

---

Adaptation is also costly.

It requires planning.

Political will.

Coordination.

Time.

And significant economic investment.

---

Hazards are unevenly distributed across the world.

And so is the capacity to adapt.

Low-income and high-income countries face very different constraints.

---

Just like Working Group I, Working Group II synthesizes thousands of peer-reviewed studies across geography, natural science, and social science.

---

The result is a massive, consensus-based assessment of how climate change affects food systems, water resources, biodiversity, ecosystem health, infrastructure, human health, economic development, and much more.

Across every continent.

---

And then we come to Working Group III.

---

Working Group III focuses on mitigation.

By mitigation, we mean reducing greenhouse gas emissions — especially CO₂ — to limit future warming.

---

It evaluates mitigation pathways.

Costs.

Economic trade-offs.

Policy decisions.

Deployment speed.

And long-term viability.

---

In other words:

Working Group I explains the physical changes.

Working Group II assesses the impacts and risks.

Working Group III evaluates the choices that shape future warming.

---

Together, the three Working Groups move from physical science…

to impacts and adaptation…

to societal decision-making.
