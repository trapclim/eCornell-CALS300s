# Working Group II — From Physical Change to Human Impacts  
*CALS303_M1_03 – Watch Script*

## Opening

In prior lessons we learned how increased atmospheric CO₂ traps outgoing longwave radiation and alters Earth’s energy balance — that’s climate change from a physical science perspective. Working Group I of the IPCC assesses that physical basis.

Much of my own research has contributed directly to Working Group I — reconstructing past climate variability, analyzing megadroughts, and clarifying the physical mechanisms behind warming.

But climate change does not stop at physics.

Some of my collaborations — including work with Ariel Ortiz-Bobea at Cornell’s Dyson School — fall squarely within Working Group II. Together, we’ve studied how rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns are already slowing global crop yields. That research translates physical climate change into measurable agricultural and economic consequences.

That is the move from mechanism to impact.

Working Group II builds on the physical foundation by asking:

**How do physical changes translate into impacts on human and natural systems?**

Working Group I establishes the boundary conditions of climate change. Working Group II begins only after that foundation is clear.

And once impacts are understood, Working Group III evaluates something different again — the tradeoffs between inaction, delayed action, and aggressive mitigation in addressing greenhouse gas emissions.

But Working Group II sits in the middle.

It translates atmospheric change into risk.

## Risk: The Core Framework

A central concept in the Working Group II assessment is **risk** — the potential for adverse consequences where climate-related hazards interact with exposure and vulnerability (IPCC, 2022b).

Risk is not determined by hazard alone. It emerges from the interaction of:

- **Hazard** — climate-related events such as heat waves, droughts, heavy rainfall, sea-level rise, and marine heat waves (IPCC, 2022b).  
- **Exposure** — the presence of people, infrastructure, crops, ecosystems, and economic systems in harm’s way (IPCC, 2022b).  
- **Vulnerability** — the susceptibility to harm, shaped by sensitivity and adaptive capacity (IPCC, 2022b).

A heat wave is a hazard.  
A densely populated city is exposure.  
Whether that city has access to air conditioning, healthcare, reliable power, and economic stability shapes vulnerability.

Risk emerges from the intersection.

## Why Context Determines Consequence

Consider a heat wave of similar intensity in two regions.

In a wealthy urban area with widespread cooling infrastructure and strong institutions, impacts may be moderated.  
In a rural region with limited electricity, rain-fed agriculture, and minimal healthcare capacity, the same hazard can produce crop losses, health crises, and economic disruption.

The hazard is similar.  
The exposure and vulnerability differ.

Working Group II finds that climate change is already affecting ecosystems and human systems across regions and sectors, and that risks increase with warming — particularly where exposure and vulnerability are high (IPCC, 2022c).

Impacts are often generated by extremes rather than averages. A single severe drought year can sharply reduce yields. A single extreme flood can damage infrastructure and housing. A single marine heat wave can collapse fisheries.

## Adaptation — and Its Limits

Adaptation reduces risk by decreasing exposure and vulnerability. Examples include:

- Redesigning infrastructure to withstand heat or floods.  
- Shifting agricultural practices to drought-tolerant crops.  
- Expanding water storage and management systems.  
- Strengthening public health responses to extreme heat.

Working Group II also assesses **limits to adaptation**. In some cases, risks can exceed the capacity of systems to adapt, resulting in losses and damages (IPCC, 2022b).

Adaptation requires:

- Investment  
- Planning  
- Institutional coordination  
- Time  

And those capacities are unevenly distributed across regions.

## Evidence and Assessment

The Working Group II report synthesizes thousands of peer-reviewed studies across the natural and social sciences. Findings are expressed using calibrated language that reflects assessed evidence and agreement levels (IPCC, 2022b).

The result is a globally reviewed, consensus-based assessment of how climate change affects food systems, water resources, biodiversity, infrastructure, human health, and economic development.

Impacts occur locally.  
But risk is structured systemically.

## Conclusion

Working Group I defines the physical boundary conditions of climate change — temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise, and extremes.

Working Group II evaluates how those physical changes translate into risk, impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation challenges across human and natural systems.

Once impacts and adaptation options are understood, another question follows:

**What choices shape the trajectory of future warming?**

That is the focus of Working Group III, which assesses mitigation pathways, energy systems, economic tradeoffs, and policy decisions (IPCC, 2022d).

Together, the three Working Groups move from physical science…  
to impacts and adaptation…  
to societal decision-making.
