# Trace Raw Data through Review Pipelines to Achieve Global Climate Consensus

## Intro

Climate science doesn't begin with consensus. It begins in the field, in
the lab, and in long, methodical processes that take years before they
ever reach the headlines. Reports like the IPCC don't create
knowledge---they synthesize it.

In this video, we'll walk that path from raw observations and individual
studies to the structured review processes that transform science into
something decision-makers can act on. We'll ground this in a concrete
example from my own research, so you can see how rigor and discipline
knit together across scales---from a single tree core to global
assessments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Main Body

Back when I studied megadroughts---decades-long droughts across North
America---I relied on data from tree rings: slivers of wood that quietly
record centuries of climate history.

Here's a photo my friend Scott St. George took during fieldwork. We were
using a Swedish increment borer---an old forestry tool---to core trees
without harming them. We didn't just count rings; we collected samples
across species and ages to reconstruct how ecosystems responded to
temperature and rainfall changes over time.

Once those cores returned to the lab, the work got meticulous. Samples
were sanded, scanned, and measured under microscopes---ring by ring.
Students and colleagues cross-dated samples, counted rings backward
through time, and spent hours aligning timelines. But raw ring widths
can't be used directly. Trees grow thicker rings when young, thinner
when older. So we "detrended" the data to isolate the climate signal.

What you get then are standardized indices, which are combined into
chronologies---averaged across trees and sites. Even producing one
chronology takes weeks or months. Now scale that up. Reconstructing
something like the North American Drought Atlas required hundreds of
these chronologies, and tens of thousands of individual measurements.

That's just one pole of climate science. On the other end are climate
models---sophisticated computer tools developed by thousands of
researchers to simulate Earth's climate under different emissions
scenarios. In our case, we married these two pillars: paleoclimate
reconstructions and model projections. By comparing past megadroughts to
simulated future drought risk, we could assess whether the coming
decades might resemble---or exceed---conditions not seen for centuries.

This is where the IPCC enters. About every six to seven years, the IPCC
convenes expert teams to assess all peer-reviewed research published
since the last report. They don't generate new data; they synthesize it.
Every study included has already gone through its own long journey of
proposal, analysis, peer review, revision, and publication.

When IPCC authors gather this body of literature, they identify where
studies agree, where they differ, and where uncertainty persists. These
assessments are compiled into chapter-length reports, and each chapter
goes through multiple rounds of expert and government review. Every
substantive comment must be addressed. Nothing moves forward casually.

The most visible product of this process is the Summary for Policymakers
(SPM). It condenses hundreds of pages into a few, but every sentence
must be traceable back to the underlying chapters. Scientists and
government representatives review the SPM line by line. The result is a
shared, rigorously constructed statement of what the evidence
supports---and where uncertainty remains.

## Outro

The value of climate assessments lies not just in their data or results,
but in the rigor of their construction. Think of it like a
cathedral---built one brick at a time, over generations, with care and
collaboration. The discipline that shapes each study, and shapes the
synthesis process, is what gives these assessments their authority.

In the next video, we'll look under the hood at how chapter authors are
selected and how reviews and drafts are constructed---because when
science serves policy, the process matters as much as the product.
