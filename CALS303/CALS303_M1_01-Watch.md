# Trace Raw Data through Review Pipelines to Achieve Authoritative Climate Assessments

Over the next few lessons, I’d like for you to have a deeper appreciation for the enormous amount of work that goes into every single statement, every chapter, of every Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report.

---

IPCC reports do not include new studies.

Instead, they assess what has already been published.

---

To show you what this looks like in practice, I want to walk you through the life cycle of my first paper to be assessed and cited in the 2013 IPCC report.

---

But before we can even talk about that paper, we need to step back more than a century into the history of tree-ring research at the University of Arizona and elsewhere.

Because that history helps us internalize how much data gets condensed and distilled into those reports.

---

Tree-ring researchers, like my friend and collaborator Justin St. George, go out with what’s called a Swedish coring device and take samples from many trees in a given area.

---

Sites are selected because the trees growing there are especially sensitive to moisture and drought, or sensitive to temperature.

They either put on thicker rings when it’s wet, or when the growing season is warmer and longer — or some combination of both.

---

Once the cores are collected, they’re brought back to the lab and sanded down with enormous care.

You have to be able to see definitively where each annual growth band starts and stops.

---

After that, the rings are measured carefully and precisely.

---

Then comes cross-dating.

Ring patterns are matched across many trees to ensure each ring corresponds to the correct calendar year.

---

Next, researchers remove age-related growth trends through a process called detrending.

This is required because trees grow more slowly as they age.

---

They shift energy toward reproduction.

And as the tree gets larger, it takes more biomass to put on a ring of equal width, simply because the radius is larger.

---

If we didn’t account for those biological patterns, we wouldn’t be able to tell whether trends were caused by climate or by the life cycle of the tree.

---

After the indices are detrended, scientists generate standardized indices for a given site and combine cores of different lengths using statistical tools.

This reduces the noise from any given tree and emphasizes the shared signal.

---

When multiple ring-width indices are detrended and combined at a site, that’s called a chronology.

---

But that’s only the beginning.

Scientists then collect chronologies from many locations to reconstruct variables of interest — like drought or temperature — over centuries or millennia.

---

One of the most important reconstructions for North America is the North American Drought Atlas.

Ed Cook and collaborators, beginning in the late 1990s and early 2000s, identified periods called multidecadal megadroughts — prolonged droughts unlike anything seen during the 20th century.

---

A number of papers have been written about these megadroughts using millions of tree-ring measurements and hundreds of chronologies.

---

Our paper took a statistical view of the problem to understand the return interval of megadroughts in the absence of anthropogenic climate change.

---

Getting it published was brutal.

One reviewer wrote that all of the authors had written extensively and insightfully on megadrought, which is why they found this effort disappointing.

---

We revised it. Improved it. Went through peer review.

It was published in 2013 and later cited in the paleoclimate chapter of the IPCC report.

---

Our paper, along with eleven others, was used to support one single claim.

One sentence.

In one paragraph.

In one section.

Of one chapter.

Of Working Group I.

---

Those twelve papers rested on hundreds of other studies.

Thousands of tree-ring chronologies.

Tens of thousands of trees.

And millions of measurements.

---

And this isn’t just paleoclimate.

Instrumental data — precipitation gauges, temperature measurements, pressure records — go through the same process.

---

Lake cores.

Cave deposits.

Climate model simulations.

The software used to generate projections.

All of it goes through a rigorous, iterative, long peer-review process just to enter the literature.

Then it is assessed again by the IPCC.

---

At the end of that process, each working group produces what’s called the Summary for Policymakers.

---

Every sentence in that summary must be traceable back to the underlying chapters and supporting literature.

---

Government representatives and lead authors go line by line and approve every single statement.

Including the United States.

Including oil-rich nations.

---

They must agree that the science documented in the IPCC supports the claims made in the Summary for Policymakers.

---

It is this enormously rigorous scientific process — with multiple rounds of revision, improvement, and consensus building — that gives climate assessments their authority.

---

The strength of the conclusions does not rest on any single study or single dataset.

It rests on the convergence of independent lines of evidence examined repeatedly under rigorous scrutiny.

---

And remember, because governments have the opportunity to soften language, anything that survives that final approval stage must be extremely scientifically robust.
