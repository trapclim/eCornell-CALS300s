# Developing Adaptive Strategies for Projected Impacts

Adapting to climate change is a little like fixing the roof while the rain is still falling. It’s messy. It’s urgent. And it reveals much about what—and whom—we value. Around the world, people are weighing how to respond to rising seas, longer droughts, and the heavy heat of summer. But there’s no clean slate to work from. Every decision is made in the context of what’s already built, already unequal, already in motion.

What makes adaptation especially difficult is that it always comes with strings attached. A seawall might protect a business district but force floodwaters into a neighborhood next door. A new crop might grow with less water but uproot generations of tradition in the process. These aren’t just engineering problems—they’re ethical ones. And the hardest part is, we don’t get to solve them once and for all. We manage them, revise them, live with them (IPCC, 2022; NCA5, 2023).

That’s where you come in. This week, you’re invited to sit with one of these dilemmas and sketch out a possible response. Don’t worry about being perfect. Just aim to be honest—about the costs, the limits, and the people who might be helped or hurt along the way. We make better decisions when we understand their weight.

### Main Discussion Prompt

Choose one type of climate impact—flooding, drought, extreme heat, or something else—and propose a practical way to adapt in a real place.

Your response should:

- Show why this adaptation makes sense in context.  
- Identify a real **trade-off** it involves.  
- Reflect on who stands to **gain** or **lose**, and how you might respond to that imbalance.

### Sub-Questions to Consider

- What limits—natural or human—could affect this plan (IPCC, 2021)?
- Are the short-term gains worth the long-term risks?
- Could this strategy unintentionally deepen divides or damage the very systems it aims to protect?
