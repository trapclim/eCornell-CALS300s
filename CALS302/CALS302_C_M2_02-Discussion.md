# Evaluating the Implications of Model Bias on Stakeholder Decision-Making

Climate predictions are not perfect. But then again, few things in life are. Models of the climate—these tools we’ve built to peer into the possible—carry with them quirks and flaws, tendencies to lean a little too warm here or a bit too dry there. And yet, even with these imperfections, they remain among the most powerful instruments we have for preparing for the future (Pierrehumbert, 2010).

For someone deciding when to plant or whether to irrigate, a bias of 2°C isn’t just a statistic—it’s a season’s yield. In regions where food systems are vulnerable, such as sub-Saharan Africa or South America, small changes in predicted temperature or rainfall can disrupt both production and livelihoods (IPCC, 2022a). For someone safeguarding the electric grid against an August surge, it’s the difference between flickering lights and a blackout (IPCC, 2022b). These are not abstract errors. They are risks, written into the everyday.

You’re now invited to take up the view from one of these vantage points. Imagine yourself as the one who must decide: Is this model’s bias tolerable? Will it steer me just enough—or too far off course? Choose a role—a farmer, a planner, a consultant, a lender—and test what that bias means in your world. The number doesn’t change. But your tolerance might.

**Main Prompt:**  
*How do climate model biases affect the reliability of climate-informed decisions in real-world stakeholder contexts? Choose a stakeholder role and evaluate whether a given bias (e.g., a 2°C temperature bias) is acceptable. Justify your conclusion based on the nature and risk tolerance of the stakeholder’s decisions.*

**Guiding Questions:**

- What are the real-world stakes for this bias—who feels it, and how?
- Is this margin of error survivable, improvable, or disqualifying?
- Might history of consistent bias become a tool rather than a flaw?

Understanding the climate is not a matter of certainty, but of judgment—of knowing when good enough is truly good enough. What we ask of these models says as much about us as it does about them. And in the end, the question isn’t only how accurate the model is, but how brave and prepared we are with the imperfect knowledge we have.
