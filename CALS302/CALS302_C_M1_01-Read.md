# Chart Key Milestones in the Evolution of Climate Science

Climate science grew out of necessity. People noticed the sky and the seasons because their lives depended on it. Farmers marked floods and droughts. They had no tools, only memory and habit. These first records were crude, but they showed that climate was not random. Patterns could be seen.  

Instruments changed everything. The thermometer and barometer gave numbers where once there had been guesses. Measurement turned experience into evidence. Climate became something you could study, not just endure.  

The nineteenth century brought a deeper puzzle. By sunlight alone, Earth should have been colder. The atmosphere held the answer. Certain gases trapped heat, keeping the surface warmer than it should be. This greenhouse effect reframed climate as a system of balance—energy coming in, energy going out, slowed by air. Today, the role of carbon dioxide in warming is beyond dispute (IPCC, 2021a).  

Industry advanced, and so did knowledge. Coal and oil powered economies and pushed science forward. Carbon dioxide moved from the laboratory to the center of climate understanding. Human influence on warming is now clear and measurable (IPCC, 2021b).  

In the twentieth century, computers and satellites extended the reach. Models simulated circulation of air and ocean. Satellites tracked radiation, ice, and storms. Tree rings and ice cores stretched the record back for thousands of years. The evidence showed natural shifts, but also that the present warming is different. Global average temperature has risen by about 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels, and models warn that 1.5°C may be reached within two decades (IPCC, 2021c; IPCC, 2021d).  

The path is plain. From observation to measurement. From description to prediction. From survival to foresight. Climate science is not the work of one person. It is a long chain of effort, each link tested by the next. Knowledge grows, but always with limits.  

These milestones are not decoration. They are markers of how far we have come. They show what is known, what is at stake, and why understanding climate is part of understanding ourselves.
