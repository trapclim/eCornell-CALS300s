**Narration (Intro):**  
Let us begin where land meets water—and where certainty begins to blur. The sea is rising. It is rising because the world is warming, and the oceans, ever faithful in their absorption of our excess, are expanding and melting the ice. This isn’t speculation—it’s measurement (IPCC, 2021a). In this video, we look ahead—not to distant centuries, but to the edges of our own lifetimes—to see how shorelines may change, and what we can do when the sea begins to come home early.

**Narration (Sea Level Rise Drivers):**  
The physics are plain. When water warms, it swells. When glaciers melt, the sea takes their place. We are filling a bathtub we cannot drain, and the overflow reaches coasts first—Boston’s wharves, Miami’s streets, the quiet marshes of the Carolinas. The oceans, like history, remember. And their rise is not just the swelling of water, but the pressing forward of time (IPCC, 2021a).

**Narration (NOAA Visualization Tool):**  
With the help of NOAA’s Sea Level Rise Viewer, we can glimpse the world the tide might reclaim. A foot of rise and a harbor floods. At three feet, neighborhoods vanish from the map. At six feet, what was once waterfront becomes underwater. You can scroll through these futures yourself. Choose a city, slide the gauge, and notice what disappears first.

**Narration (Compounded Risks):**  
But the sea doesn’t rise alone. It comes with storms—storms heavier and more frequent than before. Water that once whispered at the edge now surges inland, bringing salt where it doesn’t belong. A storm that would once make history may, in a warmer world, make headlines every few years (IPCC, 2021b). Floodplains become floodplains again.

**Narration (Stress Tests):**  
Let’s imagine a summer storm over Washington D.C. in the year 2050. Add three feet of sea level rise and the city’s pulse changes. Roads disappear, transit halts, hospitals go quiet. A city, it turns out, is not just buildings but everything that connects them. What floods isn’t just real estate—it’s routine.

**Narration (Adaptation Strategies):**  
And yet, cities adapt. They raise their roads and wrap themselves in seawalls. They plant trees on berms and turn parks into sponges for the rain. Some move uphill; some move away. In New York, engineers imagine a future where a garden might double as a barrier. Elsewhere, planners weigh the unthinkable—what if staying is not an option? (IPCC, 2022)

**Narration (Conclusion):**  
The sea will rise. That much is certain. But how high, how fast, and how devastating—that is still up to us. In the next activity, you’ll have a hand in this imagining. Choose a place. Weigh the risk. Think like a city that remembers its past and tries to prepare for its future.
