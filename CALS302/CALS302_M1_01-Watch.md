# Trace the Collaborative Evolution of Climate Science

**Narration (Intro):**  
After finishing my PhD at the University of Arizona, I moved to Boulder for a postdoc at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. I joined a climate change research group based in the MESA Lab, where the legacy of climate modeling ran deep. At the time—this was 2011—the model was still running. Not necessarily the simulations that made it into the 2013 IPCC report, but certainly the final rounds of tests, calibrations, and validations. There was a strong sense of urgency and energy in the air. Everyone knew we were standing at the edge of a new era in climate science.

The old supercomputer was still whirring away behind a long wall of public-facing windows. Rows of cabinets blinked methodically, quietly modeling the world. It was the end of one chapter, and the beginning of another. Yellowstone, a much more powerful machine built in partnership with the University of Wyoming, had just come online. The scale of possibility had shifted.

And I got to be in a weekly meeting with a legend: Warren Washington. One of the central figures in U.S. climate modeling, he helped lead the very first national efforts to simulate Earth’s climate with numerical models. Sitting in that room every week with him, learning and discussing, felt like being a young politician in 1812 in conversation with George Washington—only this Washington helped shape our digital understanding of Earth’s future.

One of the things Warren told me was that, in the early days of climate modeling, they weren’t entirely sure how much of the temperature change was just natural variability, and how much of it would be due to human influence. They didn’t know exactly what the signal would look like. But what we have now—and what Warren had already seen accumulate—is an additional forty years of standardized observations: comprehensive temperature records, surface flux measurements from oceans and land, data from flux towers, deep ocean profiles from buoys, satellite radiative balances. The list goes on. The global picture has sharpened dramatically.

But what’s striking is that even in those early models, they got it right. Add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and temperatures rise. And on average, across decades, they rise at a rate of about a quarter of a degree Celsius per decade.

Even then, the connections between modeling and the broader world were everywhere. One of our software engineers had just accepted a job at Pixar. His fluency in computational fluid dynamics—the language of swirling air, ocean currents, and smoke—was just as valuable for rendering ocean waves in *Moana* as it was for simulating global climate. The same physics. Different purpose.

## Body

A climate model is like a flight simulator for Earth. Want to test what happens when CO₂ doubles overnight? Or sunlight dims from volcanic dust? Or continents shift over millions of years? It’s all possible—and safely doable—in the digital sandbox. These are scenarios too dangerous or impractical to attempt in the real world—but models let us “run” them, rewind them, replay them.

Yet none of this emerged by magic. In the 19th century, John Tyndall showed that gases trap heat. Svante Arrhenius, with pen and paper, predicted that CO₂ build-up would warm the planet. His estimate remains in the same ballpark as we see with modern warming (IPCC, 2021a).

By the mid‑20th century, climate modeling advanced alongside computing. Early models were simple, yet by the 1950s and 60s, fossil fuel companies themselves sponsored internal modeling efforts. Documents reviewed by DeSmog confirm that between 1954 and 1956, oil and auto companies helped fund Charles Keeling’s early CO₂ monitoring work through the Southern California Air Pollution Foundation—long before the founding of the IPCC or the widespread public awareness of global warming (DeSmog, 2024).

That ambivalent sponsorship has always stuck with me. The energy needed to build and run climate models has historically come from the very system—fossil fuels—that the models warn
