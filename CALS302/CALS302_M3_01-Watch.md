# Reflect on Future Impacts of an Accelerated Signal of Change Relative to Uncertainties

### INTRO

What does climate change look like where you live? Maybe the seasons have slipped their usual slots. Maybe the wind smells different in August. Or maybe the only sign is the hum of an air conditioner that runs longer each year.

These moments, small and scattered, are part of a larger story—one in which the climate’s subtle background murmur has grown into something unmistakable. This isn’t a future we’re forecasting from guesswork; it’s a future we’re walking into, step by step.

#### A Shift in What We Expect

Not so long ago, we understood weather as a thing with boundaries. There were hot days, and cold ones. Floods, yes, but also the dry spells between them. Patterns you could fold into a farmer’s almanac and count on like the tides.

But lately, those patterns are stretching. In the U.S. Northeast, we are already experiencing seasonal temperatures and precipitation extremes beyond the boundaries of 20th-century variability (IPCC, 2022; NYSERDA, 2024). In New York State specifically, maximum temperatures have increased across all seasons, and heatwaves are projected to become more frequent, severe, and prolonged by the 2050s (DEC, 2024a).

And this isn’t limited to one corner of the map. Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes across every region of the world, increasing the severity and frequency of impacts on ecosystems, infrastructure, and communities (IPCC, 2022b).

#### Where the Trail Splits

Climate model projections show that global temperature pathways under low-emissions (SSP1-2.6) and high-emissions (SSP5-8.5) scenarios follow similar patterns through the 2040s. But after that, they diverge dramatically (IPCC, 2021a). By the 2080s, under a high-emissions scenario, summers in places like New York could regularly exceed today’s hottest days. The IPCC estimates a potential rise of about 4.4°C by 2100 under SSP5-8.5 (Anthesis Group, 2022).

The divergence is real and substantial. Under strong mitigation (SSP1-2.6), the expected warming by the end of the century is between 0.2–1.0°C. Under continued high emissions, that range increases to 2.4–4.8°C (IPCC, 2021a). And by the time we cross that threshold, some consequences will be irreversible—regardless of when or how we act.

#### Energy Has to Go Somewhere

All that extra heat doesn’t just stay in the air—it moves. Oceans absorb most of it, fueling storms and melting ice. Ocean heat content continues to rise, and with it, sea levels. According to the IPCC, global mean sea level is projected to rise between 0.63 and 1.01 meters by 2100, depending on emissions levels and how ice sheets respond (IPCC, 2021b).

Even amid uncertainties, one trend is clear: the longer we stay on a high-emissions trajectory, the more our systems—built on historical norms—will be pushed beyond their limits. And while uncertainty still exists, it matters less than it used to. As warming accelerates, the signal of climate change becomes increasingly dominant, overwhelming the background noise of natural variability (IPCC, 2021c).

### CONCLUSION

We’ve spent decades debating the odds, chasing the exactitudes. But some futures don’t need precision to feel real. A rising tide doesn’t wait for consensus.

The bridges we build now, the homes we lift, the forests we protect—these are the choices that stand between the trail we’re on and the one we could take.

Next, we’ll look more closely at how these changes will unfold, place by place, and what we might do—not just to survive the coming weather, but to shape a world we’d still want to live in.
