# **Differentiating Carbon Emission Reduction Strategies Across Regions and Sectors**

## Introduction

CO₂ emissions vary widely by country. Their sources reflect economic structure, energy systems, and infrastructure. This activity compares sector-specific emissions across four countries—**United States**, **China**, **Ghana**, and **Sweden**. The objective is to identify practical starting points for emissions reduction based on sectoral data and national context.

## Instructions

1. Visit [OurWorldInData – CO₂ Emissions by Sector](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-by-sector).
2. Select the United States, China, Ghana, and Sweden.
3. Focus on four sectors:
   - Agriculture
   - Industry
   - Utilities/Energy
   - Transportation

Answer the following prompts for each country.

## Country Analysis Prompts

1. What are the top 2–3 emitting sectors?
2. Which sector offers the best starting point for emissions reduction?
   - Consider: available technologies, existing infrastructure, political feasibility, economic role, and co-benefits.
3. What are the main barriers to action in that sector?
4. What forms of support could make action more feasible?
5. What assumptions influence your analysis?

## Sample Snapshots

<details><summary><strong>Ghana</strong></summary>  
<ul>  
<li><strong>Top sectors:</strong> Agriculture (~42%), Energy (~32%)</li>  
<li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Reduce methane from rice cultivation; expand rural solar grids</li>  
<li><strong>Barriers:</strong> Capital limitations, poor infrastructure</li>  
<li><strong>Supports:</strong> International finance, donor-led energy partnerships</li>  
<li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Stable governance and sustained external support</li>  
</ul>  
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Sweden</strong></summary>  
<ul>  
<li><strong>Top sectors:</strong> Industry (~30%), Transport (~25%)</li>  
<li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Electrify freight; scale green hydrogen for steel</li>  
<li><strong>Barriers:</strong> High investment cost, grid stress</li>  
<li><strong>Supports:</strong> EU funds, public trust in regulation, clean tech capacity</li>  
<li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Policy alignment and industrial demand stability</li>  
</ul>  
</details>

## Takeaway

Emissions data should guide strategy. Ghana and Sweden have different opportunities and constraints. Identifying realistic, context-specific points of leverage is essential. Plans must reflect sectoral profiles, institutional capacity, and available tools (IPCC, 2022a; Smil, 2010).

The next lesson addresses the risks of delayed action and the conditions required for large-scale transition (IPCC, 2022b).
