# How Fast Is Too Fast?

A glacier doesn’t just move—it sculpts. Over millennia, it can gouge valleys, flatten forests, even reshape entire continents. But if it melts in a matter of decades, nothing—not ecosystems, not economies, not the people living there—has time to adjust.

And that, in a nutshell, is the trouble with many familiar climate claims. “CO₂ has been higher before.” “The climate always changes.” They sound reasonable. There’s a kernel of truth. But they’re wildly misleading.

The real questions are these: **how fast is it changing? why is it changing? how much is it changing? and how will it affect us?** Because while Earth itself has endured comet strikes, ice ages, and volcanic winters—it’s the human world built on top of it that stands on the line.

You’ve just seen the data: temperatures rising, oceans warming, glaciers receding. Now, let’s step back to see the big picture. How does this moment compare to Earth’s past—and what can we learn by understanding those timelines?

## The Long View: Climate’s Grand Transitions

Earth’s past has seen dramatic transformations. There were Snowball Earth episodes where glaciers expanded to the equator. The Carboniferous period locked away massive amounts of carbon. The Permian ended in mass extinction spurred by volcanic greenhouse gas release.

These changes unfolded over centuries, even millennia, smoothed by slow feedbacks like weathering, carbon uptake by oceans, and plant growth (IPCC, 2021). Today, though, the system is heating faster than those clocks can keep pace. CO₂ levels are rising at an unprecedented rate (IPCC, 2021).

> **Insight:** The Permian’s warming took thousands of years—ours is happening in two generations.

## The Holocene: Civilization’s Sweet Spot

For approximately 12,000 years during the Holocene, Earth’s relative climate stability allowed agriculture, cities, and societies to flourish (NOAA, 2023). There were minor variations—like the Little Ice Age or Medieval Warm Period—but these shifts were regional and temporary.

What we see now is different. Warming is global, consistent, and coincident with the Industrial Revolution and fossil fuel burn (NOAA, 2023).

## Now: A Climate Out of Balance

Since the 1970s, data have grown impossible to ignore. Atmospheric CO₂ is above 420 parts per million. Ice is melting in polar and alpine regions. Even the deep ocean is retaining heat (NASA, 2024). In the words of a beloved climate lecturer: the Earth’s climate is like a machine powered by energy—add too much, too fast, and it will not run as before (NOAA, 2023).

## A Toolkit for Truth: Using Timescales to Understand Change

Why do myths persist? They often flatten time or misassign causes. As scholars suggest, the confusion between fast and slow transitions can misinform (Smil, 2017).

To challenge misperceptions, ask:

- **When** did it change—thousands of years ago, or within living memory?
- **What** caused it—geological shifts, solar cycles, or anthro- emissions?
- **What happens next**—can nature adjust, or are we pushing into uncharted territory?

**Example Myths & Reframes:**

- ❌ “CO₂ was higher before”  
  ✅ Yes—but that occurred gradually over geological eras—not within decades as today (IPCC, 2021).

- ❌ “There was an ice age in the 1700s”  
  ✅ True, but regional and short-lived. Today’s warming is global, accelerating, and traceable to human action (NASA, 2024).

Context and scale dismantle myths. Facts don’t just contradict—they clarify.

## What Comes Next

This page isn’t an endpoint—it’s a lens. Your next step: pick a region—perhaps your own hometown or a sensitive ecosystem—and examine how its climate has shifted across geological, historical, and recent times.

Then choose a local myth and use this timescale framework to refute it thoughtfully. Your goal isn’t just to argue—it’s to reframe the conversation. Because while the Earth itself will persist, **our societies depend on understanding how fast that change is—and acting accordingly**.
