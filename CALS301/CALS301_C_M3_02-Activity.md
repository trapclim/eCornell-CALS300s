# Comparing the Feasibility of Alternatives Across Industry Sectors

This activity presents three energy transition scenarios. Each case involves specific constraints: location, technology, infrastructure, and resource availability. The objective is to apply core metrics—EROI, intermittency, energy density, cost, land use—to evaluate the feasibility of energy options.

For each scenario, assess the available choices based on the provided metrics. After evaluating, open the solution panel to compare your reasoning with sectoral analysis.

## Scenario 1: Electrifying a Rural Village

A village of 300 households requires electrification. Solar resource is high. Grid infrastructure is distant and limited.

**Options:**
- Rooftop solar with battery storage  
- Diesel generators  
- Grid extension from a coal-fired plant (80 km)

**Metrics:**
- EROI  
- Cost per kWh  
- Intermittency  
- Infrastructure compatibility  
- Land use

<details><summary><strong>Reveal Solution</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Solar + Battery:</strong> Moderate EROI. Adequate for decentralized needs. High capital cost offset by local autonomy and low emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Diesel:</strong> High EROI. Technically simple. High fuel cost. Significant emissions and logistical burden for remote fuel delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Grid Extension:</strong> Technically feasible. Long payback. High emissions. Expensive over distance and terrain.</p>
<p><em><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Rooftop solar with batteries offers the most balanced and scalable solution under current conditions.</em></p>

## Scenario 2: Decarbonizing an Urban Industrial Zone

An industrial zone with high thermal and electrical demand must shift from fossil energy. Available land is minimal. The power grid is accessible.

**Options:**
- Rooftop solar  
- Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs)  
- Hydrogen from electrolysis

**Metrics:**
- EROI  
- Land use  
- Grid integration  
- Intermittency  
- Deployment timeline

<details><summary><strong>Reveal Solution</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Solar:</strong> Limited contribution due to area constraints. Intermittent output. Minimal impact on thermal needs.</p>
<p><strong>SMRs:</strong> High EROI. Suitable for dense, constant demand. Delayed deployment due to regulatory and public barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Hydrogen:</strong> Suitable for thermal applications. Currently low system EROI and high energy input. Not viable at large scale without significant infrastructure upgrades.</p>
<p><em><strong>Conclusion:</strong> A combined strategy of SMRs for baseload with targeted hydrogen applications offers highest feasibility.</em></p>

## Scenario 3: Powering Industrial Agriculture in the Midwest

A commercial agricultural operation seeks to reduce fossil fuel dependence. The site has sufficient land and wind availability.

**Options:**
- On-site wind turbines  
- Biofuels from crop residues  
- Electrification with storage

**Metrics:**
- EROI  
- Land competition  
- Intermittency  
- Energy density  
- Emissions profile

<details><summary><strong>Reveal Solution</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Wind:</strong> High regional suitability. Variable output requires storage or hybridization. High EROI in optimal locations.</p>
<p><strong>Biofuels:</strong> Feasible when using true agricultural waste. Efficiency and emissions vary. Competes with land and nutrient cycles when scaled beyond residues.</p>
<p><strong>Electrification:</strong> Suited for irrigation and stationary tasks. Heavy equipment electrification remains limited by current battery capabilities.</p>
<p><em><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Wind provides primary supply. Electrification supports low-load applications. Biofuels are appropriate only when derived from existing waste streams.</em></p>

## Takeaway

Energy transitions must be evaluated within local constraints. High-level metrics like EROI or emissions are necessary but insufficient without considering infrastructure, geography, and deployment timelines. Technology adoption is influenced not only by performance but also by feasibility.
