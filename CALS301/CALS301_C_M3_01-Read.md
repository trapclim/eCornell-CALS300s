## Compare the Feasibility of Alternatives Across Transition Scenarios

What makes an energy solution feasible? It works in the real world. That’s the test.

The UN says emissions must fall 42% by 2030 and 57% by 2035 to hold warming to 1.5°C. We’re not close. Even if every country keeps its promises, the world is still heading for 2.6 to 2.8°C. If nothing changes, it’ll be 3.1°C (UNEP, 2023, 2024).

Feasibility is not just about money. It’s about what can be built, when, where, and who will accept it. Solar is cheap but doesn’t work all the time. Wind is clean but irregular. Nuclear is steady but expensive and slow to build. Bioenergy may work locally but can interfere with food and ecosystems (IPCC, 2022; Smil, 2020).

No solution works everywhere. What’s good for one place might fail in another. Geography, politics, infrastructure, and labor all affect the outcome (Pierrehumbert, 2010).

There are no easy answers. We have to make choices. We have to accept limits.

The UNEP reports say we have the tools. Technologies today can cut emissions by more than half. But they only matter if we apply them where they fit. That’s what this framework is for—to compare options and make better decisions.
