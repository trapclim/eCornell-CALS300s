**Title:** *Reading Earth’s Archive: Pace, Magnitude, and Meaning in Climate Proxy Records*

In the pandemic, when we were all trapped at home, I decided to clean out the return vent for our HVAC system. It had been dirty for years. When I removed the cover, I found small red felt balls—cat toys. We got the cat in 2017 and those toys in 2018, so they must have fallen in sometime in the last two years. Beneath them were stickers. Beneath the stickers were broken crayons and small plastic toys from when our children were much younger. Farther back were objects I didn’t recognize at all. They must have belonged to the previous owners.

That vent had become an archive. Things fell in, stayed put, and slowly built up a record. Earth has archives like this too: layers of sediment at the bottom of lakes, oceans, and ice sheets. They collect what falls from the world above—pollen, ash, dust, microscopic shells. Over time, they build a layered record of what was happening on the surface (Bradley, 2015; NOAA, n.d.; IPCC, 2021b).

The things we measure in those archives—those are proxies. A certain type of pollen, the ratio of oxygen isotopes, the trace of a chemical—these are not direct observations, but they stand in for temperature, rainfall, or the presence of plants (IPCC, 2021b; Zachos et al., 2001). They give us clues. Put together, they let us reconstruct what the climate was doing, even thousands or millions of years ago.

In this activity, you’ll examine three simplified climate proxy records. Each spans a different stretch of time:

- **Record A**: 500 million years (Phanerozoic)  
- **Record B**: 800,000 years (glacial–interglacial cycles)  
- **Record C**: 12,000 years (Holocene to present)

## For each record:

1. **Trend Tales** — Is the general pattern one of warming, cooling, oscillation, or stasis?  
2. **Turning Points** — What major anomalies or transitions catch your eye?  
3. **Measures of Movement** — Estimate the magnitude of change (amplitude) and the pace (rate).  
4. **Time’s Telescope** — Consider scale: What feels “fast” or “slow” depends on the timescale. How does that shape your interpretation?

## Final Prompt: A Modern Disturbance

After reviewing these records, consider today. Why does modern climate change appear abrupt? Is it the size of the change, or how quickly it’s happening? Where does it fit in the broader story?

> ✍️ Follow-up: How does this compare to warming seen during the Permian period, when natural carbon release drove slower—but devastating—climate change (IPCC, 2021b; Zachos et al., 2001)?
