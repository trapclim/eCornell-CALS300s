### Why Scientists Trust Climate Models ‚Äî And Why Oil Companies Did Too

We‚Äôve seen what climate models say: more heat, rising seas, shifting seasons,¬† floods, droughts, and more‚Äì‚Äì but why should we trust them? One reason might be that the physics of the greenhouse effect has been understood in its essence for over a century, first by the Swedish Physicist, Svante Arrhenius. Another reason is that the oil companies did.¬†

As far back as the 1950s, oil companies took an interest in how CO2 emissions might affect global temperatures.¬†They even helped fund the early phases of the research group that would ultimately produce the "Keeling curve" ([https://www.desmog.com/2024/01/30/fossil-fuel-industry-sponsored-climate-science-1954-keeling-api-wspa/](https://www.desmog.com/2024/01/30/fossil-fuel-industry-sponsored-climate-science-1954-keeling-api-wspa/)).

In the 1970s Exxon scientists modeled how rising CO‚ÇÇ would warm the planet.  They used the same basic approach found in university labs and national agencies with models that could predict the relationship between rising CO2 and global average temperature based on the physics of the greenhouse effect. Their forecasts‚Äîroughly 0.2¬∞C of warming per decade‚Äîclosely match what‚Äôs happened ever since (Hausfather et al., 2023). These weren‚Äôt guesses. They were precise calculations made by people with a stake in the outcome.

At the center is a physical fact: certain gases‚ÄîCO‚ÇÇ, methane‚Äîabsorb long-wave radiation. They resonate at specific frequencies, just like a bridge or a tuning fork can vibrate when struck. Those "resonant" frequencies trap heat (infrared radiation), and they can be directly measured using spectroscopy: shine a light source of a certain frequency through a given gas, measure its attenuation. This has been done for decades, originally for military purposes, and the detailed results can be found in the HiTRAN database for dozens of molecules and some aerosols ([https://www.hitran.org/docs/hitran-papers/](https://www.hitran.org/docs/hitran-papers/)).

While the science of the greenhouse effect is as solid as granite bedrock, it is merely the foundation upon which global climate models are built. They expand the number and complexity of physical processes to simulate the circulation of the oceans and the atmosphere on our rotating planet, while also accounting for countless fluxes and small scale processes occurring on land, in the biosphere, the cryosphere, and deep oceans.

Think of modern climate science as the confluence of two great rivers of evidence‚Äîeach flowing from a different source, each building toward the same conclusion.

One river is **observation**. Thermometers, weather stations, satellites, and ocean buoys record the present. Ice cores, tree rings, sediments, and coral reveal climates of the past. These datasets span decades, centuries, millennia. And they show the same trend: a planet warming faster than at any point in recent geological history (IPCC, 2013, 2021b). Whether it‚Äôs the shrinking of glaciers, the warming of the oceans, or the early bloom of spring, the signal is consistent‚Äîand global.

The second river is **modeling**. It begins over a century ago, with Svante Arrhenius calculating the effects of coal emissions on planetary temperature. It flows through the first weather forecasts, through chalkboards and punch cards, through the research at Exxon Mobile, through national labs and Universities like Cornell, and arrives in today‚Äôs Earth system models‚Äîsimulating jet streams, monsoons, volcanoes, and feedbacks. These models are tested constantly: can they reproduce past climates? Can they match satellite records? Are their processes rooted in physics? Do we understand their fluxes? Do they conserve mass and energy? Do they align with one another across continents and institutions?¬†

For decades, the answer has been a resounding "yes" (IPCC, 2021a). That's because at its core, the greenhouse effect is simple and the physics of fluid dynamics is well understood. What has changed over the years isn't the underlying conclusions from these models, but our confidence in their quality and their capacity to simulate an increasingly large and complex collection of variables relevant to stakeholders, economies, and ecosystems.

When these rivers meet‚Äîhard data and tested models‚Äîthey don‚Äôt conflict. They reinforce. They churn, settle, and carry the same message forward: the Earth is warming. It‚Äôs not subtle. It‚Äôs not slow. And it‚Äôs not natural.

Finally, you might know people who say, ‚ÄúIf scientists can‚Äôt predict next Tuesday‚Äôs rain, how can they predict 2080?‚Äù But this question is equal parts misleading and irrelevant. First of all, weather predictions are accurate enough to save lives and protect the US economy every single day, and over time this adds up to billions in GDP. Those weather predictions, issued by the National Weather Service and NOAA, are based on the same physics that underpin global climate models. But global climate models are not trying to predict specific weather conditions on a specific day. They are trying to simulate the bounds, the distribution, of future plausible climates based on changing greenhouse gases.

So a better question would be this: "If we've been doing climate modeling since the 1980s, did those models predict what the recent decades would be like?" Once again, the answer is a resounding "Yes" (e.g., Hausfather et al., 2020).¬†

In the next lesson, we‚Äôll look at how this convergence of evidence‚Äîobserved and simulated‚Äîis gathered, reviewed, and translated into the reports that shape how the world understands and responds to risk.
