# Evaluating the Reliability and Relevance of Second-Order Impact Predictions

When climate science shifts from planetary truths to local consequences, certainty goes soft. The bigger picture is clear—we’re warming—but as soon as we ask what that means for Miami’s streets or Midwestern crops, we step into fog. Second-order impacts are messy. They’re drawn from real changes—sea level rise, shifting rains, heatwaves—but they drift. They're hard to pin down. Which is why they rarely make it into the sober, number-heavy consensus reports. Too murky. Too risky. Too many moving parts (IPCC, 2021a).

And yet, they won’t go away. You see them in headlines, on Twitter, in speeches at town halls. A coastal highway predicted to vanish. A new disease expected to spread. Some of these claims stir action. Others provoke eye rolls. Either way, they get under the skin. They shift how people think about climate change—and whether they do anything about it (USGCRP, 2018).

In this discussion, you’ll take three such second-order predictions—real ones, pulled from public discourse—and take them apart. Not to dismiss them. Not to defend them. Just to see what’s there. What science they build on. What leaps they take. What makes them land with an audience—or fall flat.

## Discussion Prompt

**Can second-order climate impact claims that fall outside formal consensus reports still be credible and worth communicating—and what are the risks of how they’re interpreted?**

## To guide your response, consider:

- **Which articles did you choose?** What exactly do they predict? Use the SACCHL framework. Do the claims hold up—or collapse on contact?

- **How were they received?** Trace their afterlife in the media. Did they go viral? Vanish? Did the coverage add nuance—or throw gasoline?

- **What happened next?** Did the claims change minds or policy? Did they spark useful worry or just noise? What’s the trade-off when you broadcast uncertainty?

As you respond to others, listen for the patterns. The same tropes, the same panics, the same wishful thinking. That’s the real story. The consensus reports give you the floorboards. These second-order claims? They’re the creaks and echoes above.
