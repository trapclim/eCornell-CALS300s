# Synthesize Sectoral Opportunities for Carbon Reduction

Carbon dioxide is not visible. But if it were, it would be emitted steadily from buildings, agricultural fields, transport infrastructure, and industrial hubs. Most of it comes from established systems. This page summarizes the emissions and mitigation potential of three main sectors: agriculture, buildings, and transportation. It draws on data from the 2024 UNEP *Emissions Gap Report*.

## Agriculture

In 2023, agriculture accounted for approximately 6.5 gigatonnes (GtCO₂e) of global greenhouse gas emissions, about 11% of the total. Emissions stem from livestock methane, nitrous oxide from fertilizer use, and carbon released through land-use change. Mitigation options include:

- Precision agriculture
- Feed reformulation
- Manure management
- Regenerative soil practices

Adoption varies by region. Progress depends on behavioral change, economic incentives, and institutional support.

**Strategic leverage**: Moderate.

## Buildings

Buildings do not emit directly, but require significant energy for heating, cooling, and operation. These demands are met primarily through fossil-fueled electricity and heating systems. Emissions from the global power sector totaled 15.1 GtCO₂e in 2023. Buildings account for roughly 30–40% of that.

Available solutions:

- Insulation
- Heat pumps
- Passive design
- Rooftop solar
- Efficient construction materials

Constraints include high upfront costs, regulatory delays, and misaligned incentives between building owners and tenants.

**Strategic leverage**: High.

## Transportation

The transport sector emitted 8.4 GtCO₂e in 2023, or ~15% of the global total. Road transport is the primary source, followed by aviation, shipping, and freight.

Available technologies:

- Electric vehicles (EVs)
- Urban transit infrastructure
- Hydrogen for heavy transport

Barriers include:

- Incomplete charging networks
- High EV costs
- Lack of viable decarbonization for aviation and maritime sectors

**Strategic leverage**: Medium to high (particularly in road transport and urban areas).

## 2023 Sector Emissions Summary

| Sector          | Annual Emissions | % of Total | Tech Readiness | Scalability       | Key Barriers                            | Strategic Leverage     |
|-----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Agriculture     | 6.5 GtCO₂e       | ~11%       | Medium         | Context-specific  | Behavioral norms, fragmented governance | Moderate               |
| Buildings       | ~15.1 GtCO₂e\*   | ~30–40%    | High           | High              | Capital cost, regulation                | High                   |
| Transportation  | 8.4 GtCO₂e       | ~15%       | High (road)    | Medium            | Infrastructure, aviation, freight       | Medium–High            |

## Sectoral Coordination

These sectors operate independently but intersect through shared infrastructure and demand systems. Sector-specific improvements must be coordinated to avoid counterproductive outcomes (e.g., electrified vehicles powered by coal-based electricity). Prioritizing scalable, proven interventions in each sector—retrofitting buildings, electrifying transport, and reducing agricultural emissions—offers the most practical near-term path to emissions reduction.

The next activity will compare national sector profiles. This analysis provides the basis for understanding how mitigation strategies vary by region and development context.
