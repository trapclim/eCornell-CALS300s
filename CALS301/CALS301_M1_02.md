## Title
Analyze Feedback Loops and the Thresholds of Climate Stability

## Purpose/Context
Building on the energy balance and greenhouse effect, this video explores feedback loops and their potential to amplify climate changes. By comparing Earth’s climate stability with Venus and Mars, students gain insight into the risks of destabilizing feedbacks on Earth. This comparative framework deepens understanding of feedback mechanisms, setting up the next reading on equilibrium dynamics and historical shifts in Earth’s climate, equipping students to address denialist claims that misinterpret these feedbacks.

## Prospective Outline
Define the “Goldilocks zone” as the range where a planet can maintain liquid water, placing Earth in a unique position for habitability. Establish that Earth’s position is essential but insufficient alone to maintain stability, as internal mechanisms—such as feedback loops—also regulate climate.
Analyze Venus’s climate history to illustrate how positive feedback loops, once initiated, can trap and intensify heat in a self-reinforcing cycle. Describe how this runaway greenhouse effect led to Venus’s extreme temperatures, exemplifying the destabilizing potential of unchecked feedback loops and increased greenhouse gases.
Contrast Venus with Mars, which lost its magnetic field and atmosphere, leading to the absence of liquid water and increased vulnerability to climate extremes. Explain how the lack of feedback mechanisms made Mars’s climate erratic and inhospitable, reinforcing Earth’s reliance on stable atmospheric feedbacks for climate regulation.
Conclude by highlighting Earth’s climate stability as a product of balanced feedback loops and emphasizing how increased greenhouse gas emissions threaten this equilibrium. Leave students considering how slight disruptions can lead to amplified climate changes, setting up the exploration of equilibrium and feedback dynamics in the following read.
