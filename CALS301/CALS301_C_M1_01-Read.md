# Feedbacks: Like Waves at the Shore

Picture a packed stadiumâ€”fifty thousand people in the stands, and a beach ball painted like Earth bouncing among them. It floats, dips, soars upward. A nudge from a child in the front row. A push from a cluster of hands. An exuberant fan near the aisleâ€”muscular, maybe showing offâ€”smacks it into the air. The wind catches it, changes its course. The ball doesnâ€™t move randomly; it moves because something pushed it. Many things, in fact.

That beach ball is Earthâ€™s climate. Its motion reflects both **forcings**â€”external changes like solar shifts, volcanic eruptions, or human-released greenhouse gasesâ€”and **feedbacks**, the internal processes that respond to and shape the consequences of those changes (IPCC, 2021). Together, they determine the path the ball takes.

Over the past 4.5 billion years, Earthâ€™s climate has moved in countless directionsâ€”hotter, colder, wetter, drier. But always within bounds. The beach ball has never left the stadium. Earth has remained habitable, if not always comfortable.

If forcings are the kicks and gusts, **feedbacks** are the hands in the crowdâ€”steadying, shoving, or redirecting the ball mid-flight. They donâ€™t act in unison. Their effects arenâ€™t always intuitive. And while many are still being understood, some are well known. Itâ€™s these feedbacks we now turn to.

Itâ€™s tempting to imagine them as musicians in a grand climate orchestra, but a better metaphor might be the soundscape at the seashore. Waves arrive from every direction, each with a rhythm of its own. Some amplify. Some cancel. Tide swells shift the baseline. And together, they form something patterned yet unpredictable. Climate feedbacks behave much the same way.

There are too many to list in one moment. But here are a few the science knows well.

### Stefanâ€“Boltzmann Feedback
As Earth warms, it radiates more energy back into spaceâ€”much more. According to the Stefanâ€“Boltzmann law, outgoing radiation increases with the fourth power of temperature. That makes this a powerful negative feedback: as the planet heats up, it radiates heat away faster, resisting further warming (Hartmann, 2016).

### Water Vapor Feedback
Warm air holds more moisture, and water vapor is itself a potent greenhouse gas. As the planet warms, more vapor enters the sky, which traps more heatâ€”a classic positive feedback (Hartmann, 2016; IPCC, 2021).

### Cloud Feedbacks
Clouds are tricky. Low clouds reflect sunlight and tend to cool the surface. High clouds trap heat. As Earth warms, cloud cover and type shift in ways that are still not fully predictable, creating a feedback full of uncertainty (IPCC, 2021).

### Surface Albedo Feedbacks
Bright surfaces like ice and snow reflect solar energy. When they melt, darker surfaces absorb more heat, causing more melt. This positive feedback is especially strong in polar regions but matters wherever reflective land cover gives way to heat-absorbing ground (Hartmann, 2016).

### Lapse Rate Feedback
Warming shifts the temperature gradient in the atmosphere. In the tropics, the upper atmosphere warms faster than the surface, enhancing longwave radiation escapeâ€”making this a negative feedback. In other regions, the effect varies (Hartmann, 2016).

## Carbon Dioxide: The Thermostat of Ages

And then thereâ€™s COâ‚‚â€”the usher at the stadiumâ€™s edge, guiding the motion slowly, persistently, across deep time.

Volcanoes release it. Weathering rocks and absorbing oceans pull it back in. Over geologic time, this balance has helped regulate Earthâ€™s climate. But todayâ€™s pace is far beyond what this system was built to handle (IPCC, 2021).

Smil reminds us: where once changes took thousands of years, now they happen in decades. The rhythm has changed.

<summary><strong>Historical COâ‚‚: A Record in Stone</strong></summary>
<p>Rock layers show COâ‚‚ levels above 3,000 ppm in ancient hothouse periods and below 200 ppm during ice ages. These shifts played out over millions of years. Weâ€™ve added over 100 ppm in just two centuries.</p>
