# Feedbacks: 

Picture a packed stadiumâ€”fifty thousand people in the stands, and a beach ball painted like Earth bouncing among them. It floats, dips, soars upward. A nudge from a child in the front row. A push from a cluster of hands. An exuberant fan near the aisleâ€”muscular, maybe showing offâ€”smacks it into the air. The wind catches it, changes its course. The ball doesnâ€™t move randomly; it moves because something pushed it. Many things, in fact.

That beach ball is Earthâ€™s climate. Its motion reflects both **forcings**â€”external changes like solar shifts, volcanic eruptions, or human-released greenhouse gasesâ€”and **feedbacks**, the internal processes that respond to and shape the consequences of those changes (IPCC, 2021). Together, they determine the path the ball takes.

Over the past 4.5 billion years, Earthâ€™s climate has moved in countless directionsâ€”hotter, colder, wetter, drier. But always within bounds. The beach ball has never left the stadium. Earth has remained habitable, if not always comfortable.

If forcings are the kicks and gusts, **feedbacks** are the hands in the crowdâ€”steadying, shoving, or redirecting the ball mid-flight. They donâ€™t act in unison. Their effects arenâ€™t always intuitive. And while many are still being understood, some are well known. Itâ€™s these feedbacks we now turn to.

### Stefanâ€“Boltzmann Feedback (Negative)
As Earth warms, it radiates more energy back into spaceâ€”much more. According to the Stefanâ€“Boltzmann law, outgoing radiation increases with the fourth power of temperature. That makes this a powerful negative feedback: as the planet heats up, it radiates heat away faster, resisting further warming (Hartmann, 2016).

### Water Vapor Feedback (Positive)
Warm air holds more moisture, and water vapor is itself a potent greenhouse gas. As the planet warms, more vapor enters the sky, which traps more heatâ€”a classic positive feedback (Hartmann, 2016; IPCC, 2021).

### Cloud Feedbacks (Uncertain)
Clouds are tricky. Low clouds reflect sunlight and tend to cool the surface. High clouds trap heat. As Earth warms, cloud cover and type shift in ways that are still not fully predictable, creating a feedback full of uncertainty (IPCC, 2021).

### Surface Albedo Feedbacks (Positive)
Bright surfaces like ice and snow reflect solar energy. When they melt, darker surfaces absorb more heat, causing more melt. This positive feedback is especially strong in polar regions but matters wherever reflective land cover gives way to heat-absorbing ground (Hartmann, 2016).

### Lapse Rate Feedback (Positive)
Warming shifts the temperature gradient in the atmosphere. In the tropics, the upper atmosphere warms faster than the surface, enhancing longwave radiation escapeâ€”making this a negative feedback. In other regions, the effect varies (Hartmann, 2016).

## Carbon Dioxide: The Thermostat of Ages

And then thereâ€™s COâ‚‚, which works as both a feedback and a forcing. Think of this like the architect of the statium itself: CO2 along with other greenhouse gasses not only work to set the parameters of regional and global climate, they too are affected by changes in the climate system. For example, warmer worlds in the past meant that more of the planet had forests that were more tropical by today's standards. If you've ever been to a tropical forest, you may have noticed that there is very little leaf litter. Plant material that falls to the forest floor decomposes quickly and the CO2 re-enters the atmosphere. The same must have also been true in past climates, meaning that when the earth has been locked into one of its "hothouse" phases (e.g., during the time of the dinosaurs) it can be extremely difficult to get out of it. 

There are other architects too of course: the position of the continents determines how much and where incoming solar radiation is absorbed; the shape and nature of the earth's orbit governs seasonality and the steady build-up or rapid melt of ice sheets in North America; and on billion year timescales, the output of the sun works as the ultimate thermostate. 

When it comes to CO2, however, it plays a particularly crucial role in regulating earth's global average energy balance because it happens to absorb energy at just the right wavelengths. There are of course natural "sources" and "sinks" of CO2. Volcanoes release it as do the deep ocean ridges. Weathering rocks and absorbing oceans pull it back in. Over geologic time, this balance has regulated Earthâ€™s climate. But todayâ€™s pace is far beyond what this system has seen in millenniaâ€“â€“if not millions of years (IPCC, 2021).

To paraphrase Vaclav Smil, "where once changes took thousands of years, now they happen in decades." 

The arena has changed.

<p>Rock layers show COâ‚‚ levels above 3,000 ppm in ancient hothouse periods and below 200 ppm during ice ages. These shifts played out over millions of years. Weâ€™ve added over 100 ppm in just two centuries.</p>
