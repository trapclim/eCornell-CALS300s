## Title
Identify the Role of CO2 and Energy Balance in Earth’s Climate Stability

## Purpose/Context
This video introduces core climate science concepts—Earth’s energy balance and the greenhouse effect—emphasizing how human activities are disrupting these systems. By examining Earth’s energy regulation and CO₂’s role, students build a foundation to counter common climate denial arguments that downplay human impact. This grounding in basic principles prepares students to explore how changes in greenhouse gases can lead to self-reinforcing shifts in climate stability, a topic further developed in the next video.

## Prospective Outline
Introduce the concept of Earth as a delicate, self-regulating system. Pose the question: What keeps Earth habitable, and how stable is this balance? Briefly mention that shifts in this balance are at the heart of today’s climate challenges, clarifying why this topic is essential to understand.
Explain how Earth’s climate is sustained through a balance of incoming solar energy and outgoing long-wave radiation. Highlight the role of the atmosphere in mediating this balance, focusing on how energy is absorbed and reflected.
Describe the greenhouse effect as a natural process essential for maintaining temperatures that support life. Emphasize the regulatory function of CO₂ and its critical role in stabilizing Earth’s surface temperatures.
Offer a historical perspective on CO₂ levels and climate patterns, covering trends over the past 500 million years. Focus on how past natural fluctuations differ from the current rapid increase in CO₂ due to human activities.
Analyze the unprecedented rise in CO₂ levels, attributing it to human sources such as fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. Conclude by underscoring that Earth’s once-stable climate system is under strain, hinting that this disruption has far-reaching effects on the climate's self-regulating mechanisms.
