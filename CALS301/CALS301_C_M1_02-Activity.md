# Activity: Distinguishing Contemporary Warming from Snowball Earth Cooling  

The Earth has known both fire and frost. At times, it froze nearly solid—*Snowball Earth*—when ice smothered continents and seas, reflecting sunlight away until cold fed upon itself. At other times, warmth spread, as it does today, though never quite so swiftly.  

This activity asks you to see the difference between yesterday’s icy epochs and today’s fevered climb. The physics are the same—energy in, energy out—but the story is told in reverse. Snowball Earth was a planet trapped in reflection; today’s Earth is a planet wrapped in insulation. The first was undone by volcanic breath, releasing carbon dioxide that melted the ice (Pierrehumbert, 2010). The second is driven by us, releasing carbon in amounts so vast and sudden that nature’s checks cannot keep pace (Smil, 2017; Ault, 2020).

## Part 1: Context  

- **Snowball Earth Cooling**: Albedo feedback amplified cold. White ice, spread wide, bounced sunlight back into space. Cold deepened until only volcanic emissions of greenhouse gases tipped the balance (Pierrehumbert, 2010).  
- **Contemporary Warming**: Greenhouse gases amplify heat. As humans burn coal, oil, and gas, carbon dioxide thickens the air, slowing Earth’s release of infrared radiation. Melting ice darkens the surface, oceans drink in heat, and warming hastens (Ault, 2020).

## Part 2: Questions  

**1. What was the primary feedback that deepened Snowball Earth’s global cooling?**  
- A) Increasing solar radiation  
- B) Expansion of ice cover reflecting sunlight  
- C) Growth of forests absorbing CO₂  
- D) Rising methane concentrations  
- **Correct Answer: B**  
  - **Feedback**: Ice expansion raised Earth’s albedo, reflecting more sunlight and reinforcing the cold.  

**2. Which factor most distinguishes today’s warming from Snowball Earth’s cooling?**  
- A) Today’s warming is driven by human activity  
- B) Warming occurs only at the poles  
- C) Today’s atmosphere contains no greenhouse gases  
- D) Earth’s orbit is closer to the Sun  
- **Correct Answer: A**  
  - **Feedback**: Unlike ancient cooling, modern warming arises from human industry, not slow geologic cycles.  

**3. If ice continues to melt today, which feedback loop will strengthen warming?**  
- A) Oceans reflecting more sunlight  
- B) Volcanoes increasing CO₂  
- C) Darker surfaces absorbing heat  
- D) Earth’s orbit changing  
- **Correct Answer: C**  
  - **Feedback**: With less ice, oceans and land absorb more sunlight, accelerating warming.

## Part 3: Reflection Prompt  

Why is today’s climate change not just another swing of Earth’s natural pendulum? In your response, consider both the **speed** of the shift and the **cause**.

## Outro  

Snowball Earth unfolded over millions of years, its icy stillness broken slowly by volcanoes. Today’s warming unfolds in mere centuries, lit by the fires of industry. To confuse the two is to mistake a glacier’s crawl for a wildfire’s rush. This distinction matters, for while the past was nature’s doing, the present is ours—and so is the responsibility.
